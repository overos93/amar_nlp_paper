39,https://www.woodtv.com/news/michigan/west-michigan-restaurant-chain-faces-discrimination-lawsuit/,West Michigan-based restaurant faces discrimination lawsuit,"WOODTV.com by: Jacqueline Francis, WOODTV.com staff HOLLAND, Mich. (WOOD) — A restaurant chain based in West Michigan has been sued by two former employees who are accusing them of religious and racial discrimination. The lawsuit claims two former Anna’s House employees at the Westland location, one a Hispanic woman and the other a Senegalese man who is a practicing Muslim, were fired without warning or explanation. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in federal court on the east side of the state and is working with the Michigan Chapter Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR.) It claims they have evidence the restaurant owner, Josh Beckett, has posted several things on social media that could be considered racist and Islamophobic. Closer to home, the lawsuit accuses the restaurant’s Holland location of discrimination as well. The allegations specifically refer to the firing of a Hispanic woman followed by the demotion of an African American assistant manager. “Anna’s House has engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminatory termination and demotions of managerial employees based on their respective races and ethnicities,” the former employees stated in court documents. Beckett released a statement to News 8 Thursday. “Anna’s House is aware of the lawsuit filed today. We have retained counsel and will defend against these claims in Court. Anna’s House has and continues to be a place that employs and serves people of all backgrounds and beliefs,” Beckett said in the statement. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

It happened around 5:55 p.m. in the 700 block of Poplar Street near N 5th Street. TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — Going to the gym was always part of Kari Hamra’s routine until last year’s government-ordered shutdowns forced her to replace the workouts with daily rides on her Peloton stationary bike. That’s when she discovered something surprising — she did not miss the gym. At least not the driving back and forth, filling water bottles, changing clothes and most of all, taking time away from her husband and two boys.

It is also disappointing that Amtrak leadership appears to have failed to offer a public apology for its initial mistake,” Duckworth, who lost both legs serving in the U.S. Army in Iraq, said in a statement. “The Americans with Disabilities Act has been the law of the land for 30 years. Yet in 2020, Amtrak believes it would be an unreasonable burden to remove architectural barriers that would enable a group with five wheelchair users to travel together,” she added. The Chicago-Bloomington route is priced at $16 one way, but two wheelchair users in question were told they would be charged $25,000, with an Amtrak agent telling a group booking transportation on behalf of the advocacy group Access Living that the cost was necessary to offset the cost of taking out extra seats. ""We will contact Access Living and suggest costs could be avoided by using the two separate trains on this route, with each train separated by about three hours and having three spaces for wheelchairs without any reconfiguration. We will also confirm the pricing for a railcar reconfiguration given to this important and valued customer,” Amtrak said in a statement, according to NPR. In a statement to The Hill, an Amtrak spokesperson said ""“We apologize for any inconvenience we caused our customers. Amtrak is complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and is committed to meeting the needs of all of our customers.

76,https://churchleaders.com/news/369178-trump-religious-discrimination-pray-school.html,Trump on Religious Discrimination: You Have the Right to Pray in Public School,"On Thursday, January 16, President Trump held a meeting in the Oval Office, where he announced updated safeguards against religious discrimination, including protections for the constitutional “right to pray” in public schools. “You have the right to pray,” said the president, “and that’s a very important and powerful right. There’s nothing more important than that I would say…Yet in public schools around the country, authorities are stopping students and teachers from praying, sharing their faith, or following their religious beliefs. It is totally unacceptable.” The president announced new federal guidance from the Department of Education that updates previous guidance dating back to 2003. Called “Guidance on Constitutionally Protected Prayer and Religious Expression in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools,” the updates are designed to counteract what the president called a “growing totalitarian impulse” on the far left that wants to restrict religious expression. In addition to the federal guidance, the president announced that nine federal agencies will be proposing rules to prevent religious discrimination. The White House also released a memo to make sure federal funds will not be used to violate the First Amendment. President Trump declared January 16 to be Religious Freedom Day and was joined in the Oval Office by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, and spiritual adviser Paula White. Also present were teachers and students of various faith backgrounds who have experienced religious discrimination. At the president’s invitation, they shared what they had experienced as a result of their beliefs. One young man from Colorado had, when he was in high school, started a small group that met to pray during one of the school’s free periods. “By my senior year,” he said, “it had grown into a community of 90 students.” However, the administration later prohibited them from praying during school hours, including lunch, even though the group had been meeting during school hours for the past three years. After trying to resolve the issue by meeting with the school administration, the young man filed a lawsuit against the school district. District leaders have since decided to allow students to meet to pray during lunch time (they got rid of the free period), so the lawsuit has been withdrawn. WATCH: ADF client Chase Windebank shares his story with ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ in the Oval Office. #ReligiousFreedomDay pic.twitter.com/ABGV6OvrTz — AllianceDefends (@AllianceDefends) January 17, 2020  Other highschoolers shared stories about being discriminated against because they prayed at school. One girl said that when she and her friends wanted to pray for a former classmate’s brother, the principal banned them from doing so unless they hid so that no one else could see them praying. A Muslim girl who prays five times a day while covering her hair with a hijab said that students at school made fun of her for doing so. When she told the principal, the administrator placed the blame on her. Additional stories of religious discrimination included that of a nine-year-old Catholic boy who came to class one day with ashes on his forehead in observance of Ash Wednesday. His teacher made him wipe off the ashes in front of the whole class. A Jewish girl (now in high school) told how she was harassed because of her faith in middle school. Students would put swastikas on her belongings, bully her, and even put a picture of her face on Anne Frank’s body and sent it to three schools in the area. Said the girl, “I was terrified to say I was Jewish, and that should never be in anyone’s mind.” The federal guidance states that a local educational agency (LEA) “must certify in writing to its SEA [State educational agency] that it has no policy that prevents, or otherwise denies participation in, constitutionally protected prayer in public schools as detailed in this updated guidance.” Local schools must comply with this certification in order to “receive funds under the [Elementary and Secondary Education Act].” The guidance does not specify how LEAs are to go about the process of getting certified, leaving that up to the SEAs. SEAs must report to the Secretary of Education if any schools have not gotten certified and must also report if there are any complaints against a school for denying someone the “right to pray.” The guidance not only addresses prayer but also a variety of religious rights and practices. For example, it states that, “Among other things, students may read their Bibles, Torahs, Korans, or other scriptures; say grace before meals; and pray or study religious materials with fellow students during recess, the lunch hour, or other non-instructional time to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious activities.” Among other provisions, the guidance explains how student and teacher rights are protected when it comes to groups or clubs and how students may express their religious beliefs in relation to their class work. Students are also to be allowed to dress according to their religious convictions, have equal access to school facilities, and be able to distribute religious literature so long as they do so within the school’s guidelines for any literature not related to school work. These regulations, said the president, will help with the ongoing “cultural war” in our country. He said, “You have a side that believes so strongly in prayer and it is being restricted and it’s getting worse and worse. And I think we have made a big impact. We have loosened it up a lot and I want to loosen it up totally.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,https://thewire.in/south-asia/imran-khan-pakistan-china-uighurs,Not Bringing Up Uighur Repression Because 'China Has Helped Us': Imran Khan,"""...we are really grateful to the Chinese government, and we decided that whatever issues we will have with China, we will deal with them privately,"" the Pakistan prime minister said in an interview. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan speaks during a session at the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2020. Photo: Reuters/Denis Balibouse New Delhi: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan recently said that he has been silent on the repression of Uighur Muslims because “China has helped us [Pakistan]”. Khan was speaking to Foreign Policy magazine, and was asked why he had not said anything about Uighurs even though he was a vocal critic of anti-Muslim actions in India and elsewhere. First, the Pakistan prime minister claimed that the scale of the Uighur issue was different. “One main reason is that the scale of what is going on in China—and frankly, I don’t know much about it, I just occasionally read about it—is nothing compared to what is happening in Kashmir,” he said. Earlier on in the interview, Khan had sharply criticised the Narendra Modi government’s actions in Kashmir, including the removal of special status. When pressed further, and told by the interviewer than between one and two million Uighurs in China’s Xinjiang were being detained, Khan admitted that Pakistan’s relationship with China may have something to do with his silence. “…look—China has helped us. China came to help our government when we were at the rock bottom. So we are really grateful to the Chinese government, and we decided that whatever issues we will have with China, we will deal with them privately. We will not go public,” he said. Khan, and Pakistan finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh who was also present for the interview, did not agree that Pakistan may be falling into a debt trap with China, as the US has warned. Also read: Beijing’s Cultural Genocide in Xinjiang While not much was known about just how bad things are for Uighurs in China, government documents leaked by the New York Times revealed that the clampdown against Muslims in Xinjiang has been massive. United Nations experts and activists say at least one million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim-minority groups have been detained in camps. The Chinese government is also reportedly using widespread surveillance tactics in the province. In addition, Muslim families are reportedly being forced to redecorate their homes to make them more “Chinese”, and threatened with being sent to internment camps if they do not comply. According to the leaked documents, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an “all-out ‘struggle against terrorism, infiltration, and separatism’ using the ‘organs of dictatorship,’ and showing ‘absolutely no mercy’.” Also read: The Language of the Uighur Holocaust Khan brought up India multiple times during his interview with Foreign Policy, and criticised Modi for not sitting down for talks. India has said over the last few years that it will not engage with Pakistan until there is poof that the government is cracking down on terrorists operating on its soil and on terror funding. The Pakistan prime minister also said he was worried that India might increase bombing around the Line of Control to “distract attention” from the nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/5180353/elgin-hotel-boss-smoking-discrimination-employees/,Scottish hotel owner in discrimination row after admitting she doesn’t hire ‘smelly’ smokers,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. A HOTEL owner has been branded a ""fool"" for admitting she doesn't want ""smelly"" smokers working at her guest house. Angela Wimbe says she does not have a single smoker on her staff at Heather Glen Guest House in Elgin, Moray and never has - because she doesn't feel ""comfortable"" with them. The businesswoman claims she can always tell if someone has a nicotine habit as soon as they meet as she can ""smell it on their clothes"". She said: ""I hate smoking. I can tell when I meet somebody if they're a smoker. ""As soon as somebody walks in you can usually smell [it] on their clothes. ""I hate when people come into my premises stinking of smoke."" Angela was wading into a row about whether non-smokers should be given extra time off to make up for colleagues' cigarette breaks at the time. Posting on Facebook on Tuesday, she added: ""I don't really associate with any smokers and I've no close friends that [...] are smokers because I just don't feel comfortable with people that smoke. ""I don't have any smokers working at the guest house and never have. ""As an employer, if I had two equally matched candidates for a job but one was a smoker and the other not, I would give the job to the non-smoker."" According to UK law, it is only illegal to discriminate against someone based on certain 'protected characteristics'. These include age, sex, marital status, pregnancy, disability, race, religion, and sexual orientation - and not lifestyle choices such as smoking or drinking. Angela, who has owned Heather Glen Guest House for 15 years, has faced a discrimination backlash since her smoking rant on social media. Susan Davies said: ""That's called discrimination, your a silly fool."" Lisa Ford added: ""And that leaves you wide open to a discrimination case. It's no different to not hiring someone because of their sex, age, sexual orientation, hair colour etc."" Meanwhile, Nicola Evans wrote: ""Surely it's then down to personality and whether you gel with the person? Hitting back at critics, ex-lecturer Angela said: ""Everything is discrimination. You've got to decide on something. ""If you look at somebody and you don't like their hair style, that's discrimination. ""If you don't like their voice when they talk and think 'I couldn't stand listening to that person's voice every day', that's discrimination. ""I'm just saying it. Everyone shies away from it. ""I don't discriminate against race or colour or anything like that. That doesn't bother me at all. ""But if someone came in dirty, smelling of smoke or [with] dirty fingernails, you think 'I don't want this person coming into my business' because it's not a good look."" Acas, an independent body that provides advice employment rights, claimed smoking ""should not have any bearing on whether or not to employ them"". Acas senior advisor, John Palmer, added: “Employers should think about the impracticalities and risks of refusing to employ smokers. ""As well as being a potential infringement on a workers human rights and their right to private life, if a non-smoker has been working somewhere for years and then becomes a smoker, it would likely be unfair to dismiss them on those grounds. ""It’s also unlikely to make good business sense – whether or not a worker chooses to smoke is usually going to have little to do with their qualifications, experience and abilities.""

142,https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2020/01/parent-says-son-was-harassed-sues-franklin-county-school-for-racial-discrimination.html,"Parent says son was harassed, sues Franklin County school for racial discrimination","A Franklin County Schools employee has sued the school board and several administrators, claiming they did nothing on multiple occasions when her young, biracial son was called a “n*****” by classmates and threatened with a photo of a noose. The federal lawsuit filed earlier this month claims the child was attending Phil Campbell High School the time of the alleged abuse during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years. Teachers and personnel at the school did not discipline the children responsible for the abuse, the suit says, and also did not discipline other white children the same way they disciplined her son, the mother claims in the lawsuit. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 means entities that receive federal funding are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, and are also required to have procedures in place for investigating complaints from people who believe they have been discriminated against. The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of Alabama, and court records do not reflect any responses filed by the Franklin County defendants. Lawyers for the school board did not respond to request for comment by the time of publication. The mother filed the Title VI suit on behalf of her child who is only identified by his initials M.G. The suit says the child is biracial. The mother is suing the Franklin County Board of Education and three men who were employed by the school or board at the time of the incidents. One man has since retired; the other two are still employees. Phil Campbell High School includes grades 7-12 and M.G. attended both seventh and eighth grade at the school, according to the lawsuit. The student body of the school is less than one percent non-white. “At PCHS M.G. was subjected to harassment and abuse based on his race, including one incident in which one of his teachers participated, yet school administrators and the superintendent failed to take appropriate remedial action,” the lawsuit claims. In addition to the specific incidents discussed in the lawsuit, it says “throughout the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years M.G. was subjected to racial slurs and harassment on what seemed like a near-daily basis.” The suit says the mother, who is an employee at the high school, made administrators aware of the harassment, but no school officials took any action to protect her son or discipline the children responsible. Because of the situation at the school and the lack of action by school officials, M.G.’s parents eventually took him out of PCHS and transferred him to another public school. The lawsuit details several incidents of racial harassment M.G. claims to have experienced at the high school. The first incident described in the suit happened in October 2017, according to the lawsuit, when M.G. and another student, who was white, got into a fight in the lunchroom. While video shows both boys were equally involved, the then-assistant principal gave M.G. three and a half days of in-school suspension but did not discipline the white child. “Roughly a month later, M.G.’s mother insisted that M.G. report the harassment rather than depend on her to do it. Therefore, on November 13, 2017, M.G. told (the assistant principal) that in PE students would call him the N-word and a stupid N-word and tell him he belonged in the cottonfield,” the lawsuit states. “M.G. reported this to (the assistant principal) as an ongoing problem. M.G. identified specific students. (The assistant principal) assured M.G. that he didn’t deserve to be talked to like that and assured M.G. and his mother, who was present, that the issue would be addressed."" The assistant principal also told M.G. that if the abuse continued to report it again so it could be handled. But, the suit says the harassment continued. The next day, on Nov. 14, 2017, M.G. faced a racial slur from one of his basketball teammates while on the bus. “When M.G. spoke with (the assistant principal) about what happened on the bus, (the assistant principal) told M.G. that if he was going to be a troublemaker that he needed to just turn his basketball jersey in, that they didn’t have time for trouble on a ball team. (The assistant principal) told M.G. that if he couldn’t get along with other teammates, there was no place for him on the team.” The lawsuit claims the school never took action regarding the racial slur on the bus. One month later, the suit says, M.G. and some of his teammates were involved in “some mischief” in a locker room. M.G. was the only one punished-- all of the other teammates were white and were not punished. “Perhaps most emblematic of (the assistant principal’s) attitude toward racial harassment at PCHS was his handling of M.G.’s basketball teammates playing a racist song called ‘Alabama N-word’ in the locker room during the 2017-18 basketball season,” the lawsuit says. “Perhaps reluctant to speak up lest he be forced to give up his basketball jersey, M.G. did not initially tell his parents about the song. Eventually M.G. told his parents, and, in approximately December 2017, M.G.’s mother spoke to (the assistant principal) about the song. (The assistant principal) said he ‘would look into it and make sure the coach knew.’ The playing of the song continued until the end of the season in January 2018. It was left to M.G.’s father to confront the basketball players, which he did during the county tournament, asking the players if they were prejudiced against MG because of his skin color.” In March 2018, the suit claims, M.G. was again the target of a racial slur when his class was watching the movie “42” during a lesson. “When the N-word was said in the movie, which happened numerous times given the subject matter, the students would laugh and point at M.G. M.G looked to the teacher for help, and she just laughed,” according to the lawsuit. When the child’s mother brought up the incident to the superintendent, the principal, and the assistant principal, she said no action was taken. In May 2018, M.G. received several awards at a school ceremony. The lawsuit claims students sitting by M.G. said things like “you're still a stupid N-word” and put gum on his pants. Again, the suit says the defendants did not do anything about the harassment when it was reported. In October 2018, the lawsuit claims the assistant principal, who was also the ninth grade basketball coach, demoted M.G. from the ninth-grade basketball team, even though he had played on the team the prior year and had again been chosen for the team during try outs. The lawsuit claims several white students who had been harassing M.G. were moved up to the team to take M.G.’s place. The lawsuit also mentions an incident from Nov. 15, 2018, involving another student. “On that date, a male student, S.B., in front of numerous other students, threw basketballs at M.G., subjected M.G. to numerous racial slurs, showed other students a picture of a noose, and told M.G. he was going to hang him. M.G.’s parents did not learn about the incident until Sunday, November 25, 2018, after receiving calls from parents of some of the other students who witnessed it. M.G.’s parents also learned that S.B. reportedly made a threat to shoot up the school.” M.G.’s mother contacted school administration and, because of the shooting threat, police were contacted and interviewed S.B. at school the next day. The lawsuit says S.B. was allowed to return to class and school officials did not report the comments about M.G. to police. The suit says S.B. was not disciplined, and school officials allowed S.B.’s mother to withdraw him from school without any negative marks on his academic record. M.G.’s parents filed criminal charges. “The failure and refusal of the individual defendants to protect M.G. from continued harassing, intimidating, and racially-aggressive behavior of other students deprived M.G. of educational opportunities enjoyed by his white colleagues, that is, the right to attend public school on a daily basis without the fear, embarrassment, intimidation, and mental anguish associated with pervasive and continuing racial harassment,” the lawsuit says. “The individual defendants… were responsible for taking action to protect M.G. from harassment yet failed and refused to do so.” The mother is suing on two counts of racial discrimination.

157,https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/jewish-professor-sues-point-park-university-for-alleged-discrimination/,Jewish professor sues Point Park University for alleged discrimination,"A longtime professor at Point Park University has sued the institution claiming employment discrimination based on her Jewish and Israeli ancestry, and alleging that there has been a concerted effort led by anti-Zionist faculty and students to create a hostile work environment. Channa Newman, a Holocaust survivor with U.S., Israeli and Czech citizenship, has been employed by Point Park since 1964. She is currently the chair of the department of humanities and social sciences and is a professor of French and cultural studies. In her 18-count complaint filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Newman alleges that Professor Robert Ross, an outspoken critic of Israel, used his position at Point Park to promote “highly anti-Zionist views and activities” and to “foster the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.” She says that Ross and others sought to have her removed from her position because she did not acquiesce to their one-sided presentation of the conflict. Get The Jewish Chronicle Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up She is seeking redress for emotional distress, physical manifestations of emotional distress and harm to reputation. Newman claims in her complaint that, with the support of Point Park, Ross along with Professor J. Dwight Hines, have “advanced militant and hateful views against Israel and in favor of BDS that are anti-Semitic and lead to the creation of a hostile work environment.” The anti-Zionists on campus tried to remove Newman from her position at Point Park through the filing of a Title IX complaint against her, in which a student claimed that Newman made an insensitive comment about the #MeToo movement, Newman alleges. Newman was exonerated from those charges, but not before she had endured significant maltreatment from the university, including having her classes cancelled mid-semester, being prohibited from campus and being denied access to her email, she claims. This may be the first time that anti-Israel activists have used Title IX — a federal law that protects those on campus from sexual harassment — as a pretext to have a faculty member removed, according to Newman’s attorney, James Lieber of Lieber Hammer Huber & Paul. “It is a very heavy charge in academia,” explained Lieber. “Title IX is very important to stop sexual misconduct and sexual harassment on campus. This is the way, if you really want to go after somebody who has tenure, you can do that. People involved with BDS, they have bullied people on other campuses, they have boycotted them in various ways. But this is the first time that Title IX has shown up (as a BDS tool) anywhere in the United States. “This is not a real Title IX charge, it has nothing to do with sexual harassment or anything like that,” Lieber added, noting that the student filed the claim against Newman only after consulting with Ross and Hines. “Then she filed a formal charge and the university took it, and without notice, removed Channa from her classes and — this was really part of the very serious emotional damage I would say — they announced it to the students by email before they even told Channa. So she came to school and the students were telling her about this and she had no advanced notice.” Newman contends that she has been targeted by Ross, Hines and their student followers because she has put up some resistance to the anti-Israel rhetoric and activities they promote. “It was because I opposed the BDS thrust on campus,” she said. “I wasn’t trying to silence the pro-Palestinian impetus there, but I was trying to bring a two-sided perspective. This was too one-sided, and very offensive to me, obviously. One of my countries was being attacked. I just wanted transparency.” Ross is an associate professor and coordinator of Point Park’s Social Justice Studies Program. He is a prolific writer on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. His articles include: “No Space for Apartheid: Toward an Academic Boycott of Israel Among Geographers” (2016, The Geographical Review), “One Year Later, Gaza Is Still in Crisis” (2015, Mondoweiss) and “How The New York Times Erases Israel’s Crimes” (2012, The Electronic Intifada). He leads Palestinian advocacy efforts on behalf of the Presbyterian Church’s Israel/Palestine Mission Network, and is member of the Organizing Collective of the U.S. Campaign for an Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel. Ross also sits on the board of trustees for Friends of Sabeel North America, an organization that appears on an Anti-Defamation League list of the top 10 anti-Israel groups in America. Ross uses “teaching, speaking, social media, writing and taking PPU students on trips including with substantial university support financially and/or with scheduling” to promote a bias against Israel, and is supported in those endeavors by Hines, according to Newman’s complaint. The complaint further states that in or around 2015, Ross tried to introduce a course titled “Israel: A Settler State” for all first-year Point Park students, although the class never came to fruition. When Newman asked Ross if he would include views that were more balanced, either through herself or others, he declined, according to her complaint. Ross maintains that social justice demands standing up for all those who are victimized, including students. “This lawsuit attempts to use my work in the movement for Palestinian human rights as a basis to attack my support for students who felt victimized by a professor last academic year,” he said in an email to the Chronicle. “Like my solidarity with the Palestinian people, my commitment to ensuring that students have access to education in an environment free of traumatizing harassment is rooted in the belief that all people — regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, gender, class, age, ability or orientation — should be treated equitably. I stand in solidarity with all struggles for equity and liberation, including the Palestinian freedom struggle, the struggle to combat anti-Semitism and the #MeToo movement. It is necessary to support these movements if we are to fully achieve social justice in our world today.” After the Title IX complaint was filed against Newman in Oct. 2018, Lieber said, a search ensued on social media in an effort to find any additional information that could be used against Newman. “One of the worst things that can happen at a university is when students become mobilized or weaponized,” he said. “When Channa was off the campus and banned from her email, there was a student chat room that was set up with ex-students. One was Dr. Ross’s principal supporter on campus, and what they were trying to do was to get ‘anything’ on Channa Newman.” Newman was informed about this chat room by another student. “They were going beyond this Title IX claim,” Newman said. “And I wasn’t even sure how they got news of that because it’s supposed to be confidential. They wanted to go beyond that to anything, all my teaching. They said the school was looking into everything about me.” Point Park denies all allegations of wrongdoing contained in the complaint, “and will vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit,” said Lou Corsaro, Point Park’s managing director of marketing and public relations, in a prepared statement. “Point Park is an inclusive community free of discrimination. As a matter of policy, the university welcomes and supports all faculty members regardless of their race, gender, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, physical ability and political affiliation. Point Park embraces and actively pursues a policy of inclusiveness that reflects the diversity of the community it serves.” Although Newman was cleared of the Title IX charges, the environment at Point Park remains hostile against her, she said. “It was fortunate for me that I was vindicated, I was exonerated,” she said. “But it hasn’t really stopped. It would have been difficult to overcome what they did to me with this Title IX if I were treated fairly thereafter. But it just sort of continues. I can’t even recover from that. It was just horrific.” When she returned to Point Park, she received a notice from the Title IX office that she was being investigated again, according to her complaint. “She spoke to the Title IX coordinator, and there were students involved but they were not named,” said Lieber. “They didn’t tell her what the charges were, and we don’t know who the students are.” Newman feels that she must remain “on guard” and she continues to be “shunned,” she said. “My reputation is really damaged. It hurts.” Newman filed her lawsuit for the sake of “education and deterrence,” explained her attorney. “It’s important to stand up, and Channa has done that.” pjc Toby Tabachnick can be reached at ttabachnick@pittsburghjewishchronicle.org.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,https://urbanintellectuals.com/detroit-man-goes-cash-race-discrimination-lawsuit-check-bank-refuses-calls-cops/,"Detroit man goes to cash his race discrimination lawsuit check, then bank refuses and calls cops! | Urban Intellectuals","by gamma | Jan 24, 2020 | News | 0 comments The trials and tribulations of doing just about anything whilst Black! Imagine, you win a race discrimination lawsuit, you get the check from your “alleged” racist-ass employers and then the darn bank goes and throws more racism back in your face. This isn’t some old-timey story, this is the ish happening today, in 2020. And this was what happened to Sauntore Thomas. As the Detroit Free Press reported: First, the Detroiter sued his employer alleging racial discrimination in a lawsuit that settled confidentially. Then he went to the bank this week to cash his settlement checks, but the Livonia bank refused to cash or deposit his checks. Instead, they called the cops and initiated a fraud investigation — actions that dumbfounded Thomas and his lawyer, triggering another lawsuit. On Wednesday, Thomas sued TCF Bank for alleged race discrimination, saying the Livonia branch mistreated and humiliated him by calling four police officers when all he was trying to do was deposit legitimate checks. According to police, the bank’s computer system read the checks as fraudulent. TCF Bank spokesman Tom Wennerberg said Thursday that TCF abhors racism and it was not a factor in how the bank handled Thomas’ requests. He said the checks Thomas presented displayed a watermark that read VOID when they were scanned in a web viewer.  Thomas isn’t buying it, noting the check cleared 12 hours later. He’s upset that two officers questioned him inside the bank, while two others stood guard outside, he said, adding he was an account holder for nearly two years at that TCF branch. “I didn’t deserve treatment like that when I knew that the check was not fraudulent,” Thomas told the Free Press. “I’m a United States veteran. I have an honorable discharge from the Air Force. They discriminated against me because I’m black. None of this would have happened if I were white.” Read the full story in detail here on the Detroit Free Press.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Just weeks into their probe of racism and dysfunction in the Peel public school board, three provincial reviewers say they have already “consistently heard painful accounts of traumatic experiences in schools and school communities.” The “narratives shared with us signal a profound lack of respect in relationships, demonstrated by stories of marginalization, discrimination, differential behaviour, and harassment,” says their interim report, obtained by the Star. Ena Chadha, Suzanne Herbert and newly appointed reviewer Shawn Richard are looking into complaints of racism — in particular anti-Black racism — as well as issues overall with equity, hiring and leadership. Education Minister Stephen Lecce ordered the investigation in early November after the Peel board reached out for help as it grappled with allegations of anti-Black racism, a trustee who referred to the diverse McCrimmon Middle School as “McCriminal,” and after a senior administrator in charge of anti-discrimination launched a human rights complaint. So far, the review team has received more than 350 interview requests as well as email, mail and phone submissions, which they characterize as a “strong” public response. The review began in December, and that month alone they spoke to 50 people, both individually and in groups. Richard, a lawyer, was appointed later last month after concerns that no one from the Black community was on the front lines. At the time, Lecce noted that the entire review was being overseen by assistant deputy education minister and human rights lawyer Patrick Case, a prominent member of the Black community who was part of a review team in 2017 — with Herbert — that issued a scathing report on racism and a lack of leadership in the York Region District School Board. The trio filed their interim report on Peel to Lecce on Dec. 30, and their final report is due by spring. In a statement, Lecce said he has met with the reviewers “to better understand their immediate observations of systemic anti-Black racism, and lack of adherence to governance, leadership, trustee conduct” and hiring and promotions practices. “I believe students and families deserve better,” Lecce said. “It is my hope that the final report will build momentum for the transformational change racialized families are seeking, after a period of inaction.” Their interim report says “we have received written and oral submissions from many individuals and groups representing diverse perspectives on the issues within the scope of the review.” The reviewers have also been examining “various documentation, minutes of board meetings, board policies and data. We have consistently heard painful accounts of traumatic experiences in schools and school communities that speak to systemic and historical disparities between and across racial, ethnic and cultural groups with respect to access to programming, services, academic achievement, transitions to post-secondary education and the workforce, hiring, and promotion, as well as discipline measures both in education and employment.” They go on to say that a “profound lack of respect (is) demonstrated by stories of marginalization, discrimination, differential behaviour, and harassment. To date, these sentiments relate to leadership, governance, human resources, anti-Black racism, Islamophobia and other forms of inequities put forward by students, parents, educators, staff, senior administrators, elected officials and community members who we have met with thus far.” The Peel District School Board is the second largest in the province, with more than 155,000 students in Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon schools, and about 17,000 staffers. Its student body is highly diverse, with the three largest groups identifying as South Asian (45 per cent), white (17 per cent) and Black (10 per cent). So far, the reviewers say that “all stakeholders, from students and parents to educators, staff, senior administrators, trustees and community members, have expressed consensus that the review is a much needed intervention to better understand the challenging and compounding dynamics operating within the (Peel board) and broader community.” However, there has been some criticism that given the tight timeline, the review will not be as comprehensive as needed. The reviewers say they will identify the problems and make recommendations, but more work will need to be done. The board, they say, will need a “process that will allow community members to directly ‘speak their truth’ to trustees and senior staff” in order to “regain public confidence that will be necessarily longer-term and that will be monitored by the ministry,” they wrote. Those they’ve interviewed “have told us that they expect that this review will assist the (Peel board) to become more transparent and responsive in its commitment to provide inclusive learning and working environments where all students and staff feel respected.” Last month, Lecce himself met with some Peel community members who told him part of the problem is a lack of diversity among teachers. Lecce said that Regulation 274, which was brought in under the former Liberal government, impedes boards in hiring because it forces schools to hire the most experience supply teachers for full-time jobs, rather than their top choice or who will be the best fit. The regulation is a part of the current negotiating round between teacher unions and the province. The Peel review team had at least 13 days of interviews in January — in Brampton, Mississauga, Malton, Etobicoke and Toronto — and notes that “considering the urgency to complete this review and the volume of requests to participate in the review process, we will not be able meet with everyone who has expressed interest” but promises that all written submissions will be looked at. Lecce said he wants families to know the government “is listening and is fully committed to combating racism and improving equity and opportunity for their children.” He pledged to “continue to empower students — notably from racialized communities — to be a part of the solution, to have a voice, and to work collaboratively to eliminate obstacles to academic success and well-being.” Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

303,https://dubaiofw.com/religious-discrimination-fine/,Up to AED 1 Million and 5 Years Jail Time for this Form of Discrimination in UAE | Dubai OFW,"Since the UAE’s Anti-Discrimination Law has been put into effect in 2018, the government has been very keen on addressing issues that concern this matter. And because the UAE is a melting pot of culture, colors, and traditions, this is especially important for its residents. Credits: Ariful Haque Bhuiyan/Flickr According to the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, “any act that insults the divine entity, any religion, Prophet, Messenger, divine book or house of worship will be considered contempt of religion and the offender will be jailed for five years and penalized up to AED 1 million”, as shared in a report by the Gulf News. Expounding on the topic, Ameena Al Mazrouei, Social Responsibility Specialist at the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, shared, “We stand against the differentiation of people based on their caste, creed, and color, and the offender will be jailed for five years and penalized up to Dh1 million as per the rules of the country.” “We respect all human beings and ensure they get fair services and justice. Whoever they are, irrespective of their religion, nationality, background or culture, they are treated equally here in the UAE. Everyone gets justice equally,” Al Mazrouei added. There is a specific law in the UAE which details the sanctions for this type of offense: Federal Law No (2) of 2015 on Discrimination and Hate, Article (4) penalizes the offender with fines ranging from AED 250,000 to AED 1 million and five years jail. The law pertains to the act of “offending any religion or any of its sacred things, disrupting or preventing religious observances or ceremonies by violence, distorting in any way, any of the holy books, destroying or desecrating the sanctity of places of worship, graves, appurtenances or any of their contents.” Al Mazrouei explained that the law comes down heavily against anyone who insults a religion, desecrates it or vandalizes a house of worship, whether it is a mosque, temple, synagogue, church or gurdwara. Concerning this, the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department held an exhibition “Following the Steps of Zayed – Justice and Tolerance”. In an earlier exhibition, the ADJD displayed a series of efforts of the department to spread the message of peaceful coexistence, communal harmony, religious tolerance, and respect to all faiths among community members. Commenting on this, Al Mazrouei noted: “If people are talking on social media sites, they are not allowed to disrespect any religion, faith or God. In case there is a breach, offenders will be charged under contempt of religion laws and will be penalized.” She added that they are also focusing on social media, where many people text messages at will and don’t realize that they may be hurting the feelings or beliefs of some others.

362,https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/st-louis-county-reaches-agreement-settle-discrimination-lawsuit-gay-lieutenant/63-00b11d85-6521-477d-bd2b-e5b0feba0b15,St. Louis County reaches agreement in discrimination lawsuit,"ST. LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. — St. Louis County has reached a preliminary agreement to settle a discrimination lawsuit with a gay police lieutenant, a source told 5 On Your Side. The deal comes after a jury awarded Lt. Keith Wildhaber nearly $20 million following a five-day trial in October 2019. The amount of the agreement has not yet been disclosed. The deal is expected to be finalized within the next several days. Attorneys for the county and Wildhaber arrived at the settlement Thursday with a mediator, retired Judge Glenn Norton. It was the third time the two sides met to discuss a settlement. Wildhaber left the settlement meeting without comment. The county has spent about $250,000 for the Lewis Rice firm to handle the mediation and prepare for an appeal had it fallen through. How the county is paying for the settlement remains unclear and whether the county's insurance companies will cover any of the cost is uncertain. Council members have speculated that Page’s administration is planning to use Prop P funds to pay for it – an issue that came to a head Wednesday when County Councilman Tim Fitch asked county counselors to draft an ordinance forbidding it. Fitch said he can’t get a straight answer from Page’s administration on whether it will happen, so he asked for the legislation. Page’s spokesman Doug Moore sent a statement to 5 On Your Side Thursday evening. ""We cannot comment on pending litigation. During the mediation process, we are bound by a confidentiality agreement. The council does not have to approve any settlement reached by our county counselor. Until we have an agreement, we cannot speculate on where the funds would come from. However, any settlement amount would likely be paid out over multiple years,"" Moore emailed. He previously referred questions to County Counselor Beth Orwick, who responded, “I cannot comment on pending litigation. Additionally, I am bound by a confidentiality agreement, which is standard for parties involved in the mediation process.” There is additional fallout to come from the case as well. Wildhaber sued the county in 2017, saying that he had been passed over for promotions because he is gay. He then filed an additional retaliation claim after he was transferred to a different district and a less desirable shift after he filed his lawsuit. Wildhaber’s attorneys have said in post-trial motions that there were “multiple” offers to settle the case through the years before it ever went to trial. For example, Wildhaber offered in April to settle the case for $850,000. Jury members deliberated about three hours before awarding Wildhaber $1.9 million in actual damages and $10 million in punitive damages on the discrimination allegation. Jurors added $999,000 in actual damages and $7 million in punitive damages for Wildhaber’s retaliation claim. In Missouri, half of punitive damages must go to the state’s Tort Crime Victims' Compensation Fund. In Wildhaber's case, that was about $17 million. The most Wildhaber could have gotten was about $11 million once the state’s portion and attorney’s fees were subtracted. Also during the five-day trial, witnesses testifying on Wildhaber’s behalf described multiple incidents of discrimination and homophobia against gay people within St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar’s administration. One of the most dramatic moments in the courtroom included testimony from a woman who said St. Louis County Police Captain Guy Means told her Wildhaber was “too fruity” to get promoted. On the stand, Means denied under oath ever saying that as well as knowing the woman. She returned the next day with photographs of the two of them hugging and smiling together in a photo booth at the event where she said he made the remark. Means has since been transferred to police headquarters, where Wildhaber now works. Other officers claimed Wildhaber asked for the transfer to the Jennings Precinct from his Affton Precinct. Belmar said he refused to promote Wildhaber because he was concerned that he tipped off a bookie that he was the subject of an FBI investigation – a claim Wildhaber’s attorneys denied, and noted that Belmar never opened an internal affairs investigation into the matter despite his concerns. St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell announced he was opening an investigation into whether any county officers committed perjury on the stand during the trial, but so far, none has been charged. Page also replaced four of the five members of the St. Louis County Police Board of Commissioners following the verdict. The board is in charge of hiring and firing the police chief. Judge David Vincent III ordered both sides to enter into mediation following the verdict. The settlement also avoids the county’s appeal on the matter, in which county counselors were preparing to argue that the verdict should be thrown out because it is legal to discriminate against gay people in Missouri. Wildhaber has since been promoted to lieutenant and has been put in charge of a newly-formed Diversity Unit.

378,https://ctmirror.org/2020/01/10/council-gets-input-from-incarcerated-people-about-discrimination/,Council gets input from incarcerated people about discrimination,"Free Daily Headlines :  LET�S GET SOCIAL Rep. Robyn Porter talks with an inmate who shared his experience with the council Thursday afternoon. (Photo courtesy of the Department of Correction.) Somers – Before kicking him off the car dealership property, the hiring manager told Jose — who’d applied for a job there — the fable of the scorpion and the frog, an allegory that cautions the listener to never forget the nature of others. The employer told Jose he viewed him as a liability because of his criminal record. “I subconsciously resolved myself to the life of a scorpion,” Jose recalled Thursday, more than a decade later. “Until my recent term of incarceration.” Jose relayed his story Thursday afternoon from inside Cybulski Correctional Institution, where he is currently imprisoned, to members of the Council on the Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction. The council is charged with submitting legislative recommendations by Feb. 1 on how to reduce discrimination against those with criminal records. According to a national study, those with criminal records face more than 550 barriers codified in state statute that make their lives harder after they’re released from prison. Thursday’s forum was a part of the council’s research into those forms of discrimination. Members asked those offering testimony to identify themselves by only their first names to ensure anonymity. “The importance of it, for me, is what I can glean from the story. Not who it is, but what it is,” said Rep. Robyn Porter, D-New Haven. “I don’t want to further stigmatize them by using their full names.” Each of the 25 men who offered their stories are housed in the prison’s Reintegration Center, which means they will soon be released — some for the first time in decades. Jose has spent more than 10 years behind bars. During that time he has taken college classes in finance and business, earned a 4.0 GPA, and has been accepted into a national honor society. He plans on opening his own car dealership in New Haven when he is released from prison. But he still remembers the business owner who told him he couldn’t change his nature. “That was long ago,” Jose said. “I won’t forget because it motivates me, and it keeps me ready for what I’m going to do in the future.” Many of the inmates’ concerns were related to housing and employment discrimination. Several men explained how they had been passed over for jobs because of their records, whether through discrimination or because they didn’t have the same skills as people who hadn’t been locked up. Others said they are worried about obtaining life insurance, or getting a commercial drivers’ license when they are out of prison. Andrew, who has spent the last 29 years in prison, said he is anxious because he’s been incarcerated for so long. “I have concerns about all the questions, but they apply to a world I have not walked in for a very long time,” he said. “All I can do is pray I’ll be ready to face them with a positive outlook.” Another man — Louis, from Waterbury — told the council he’d been denied multiple jobs at corporate restaurants, despite having 25 years of experience as a chef. His felony convictions held him back, he said. “As a recovering addict, it is hard to work in a restaurant that serves alcohol,” he said, explaining it would be better for his recovery to work somewhere that would not trigger a relapse. “I would love to stay in my field and work in a safe space.” Only five of the council’s 21 members attended Thursday’s meeting. They were Porter; Melvin Medina, public policy and advocacy director of the ACLU of Connecticut; Tiheba Bane, the founder of Women against Mass Incarceration; Arunan Arulampalam, deputy commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection; and William Murphy, the Department of Correction’s director of programs and treatment. “I absolutely would have loved to see more of my council members there, especially legislators,” Porter, the council’s co-chair, said. “We write laws that impact the lives of people, and these are some of the most forgotten-about people that we represent. You lose a lot when you don’t hear firsthand from them, out of their mouths, what their experience is, and what their solutions and suggestions are.” There will be another forum this morning at York Correctional Institution in Niantic, to hear from inmates at the state’s only women’s prison. Matthew, who is finishing his first stint in prison, said he surveyed his peers before addressing the council Thursday. He told the story of a former banker who lost his career because of a felony conviction. That man turned to independent contracting, but he eventually lost that job, too, because of his record. “Thus, not only are we struggling to get jobs,” Matthew said, “felons are struggling to be self-employed or to have their own businesses.” Medina told the men he empathizes with them. “What I kind of lift up from your story is the difficulty of trying to get back on your feet, trying to get a job, trying to get housing, and every ‘No’ feels like you have no value,'” he said. “That’s the challenge that we’re trying to educate the world outside. That it’s not just the criminal record, it’s everything associated with the criminal record, that stigma, the idea that you don’t have value.” “Your story’s valuable,” Medina added. “You matter.” The Connecticut Mirror is a nonprofit newsroom. 90% of our revenue comes from people like you.

411,https://www.opb.org/news/article/washington-legislature-discrimination-hair-race-bill/,Washington Lawmakers Consider Ban On Race-based Hair Discrimination,"Suppporters of a bill to ban race-based hair discrimination pose for a photo following a public hearing in Olympia on Tuesday. Austin Jenkins / Northwest News Network Washington could become the fourth state in the nation to outlaw race-based hair discrimination, after New York, New Jersey and California. On Tuesday, a panel of state lawmakers heard passionate -- and unanimous -- testimony in favor of legislation that would define race to include traits such as hair texture and hairstyles like Afros, braids, locs and twists. “Long, short, curly, braided, twisted, I should not have to be conflicted about any aspect of my physical appearance,” said Andrea Jarmon, an African American attorney. Michelle Merriweather, the president and CEO of the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, described the hair of black women as “a crown that tells a story.” “A story of struggle, triumph, pain, pride and comfort,” Merriweather said. Merriweather and Jarmon were among several people – mostly black women – who testified before the House Civil Rights and Judiciary Committee in favor of the hair discrimination bill. Several described the pressure black women have historically felt to use chemicals to try to straighten their hair. “In order to gain employment, black women have had to assimilate into the white culture,” said state Rep. Melanie Morgan, a Tacoma Democrat, who is the prime sponsor of the legislation. “This means we go from naturally curly hair to a sleek relaxed look of removing all curls. This is unhealthy for our hair, but also dangerous for our skin and breathing in during application.” Related: Washington Lawmaker Wants Hairstyles Protected Under State's Anti-Discrimination Law Hair discrimination also dates to slavery, explained Angel Swanson, who teaches a workshop titled ""How to talk to your racist uncle."" Swanson told the legislative panel that slaves would braid maps into their hair as a form of communication. ""When that was discovered hair was to be shorn at that point,"" Swanson said. Under current Washington law, race-based discrimination is prohibited. The proposed bill would amend the state's Law Against Discrimination to say that the definition of race includes traits historically associated with or perceived to be associated with race. Lawmakers also heard from Jenna Hanchard, a former television news anchor, who read from an email she received from a viewer last year. Related: Washington Voters Narrowly Reject Effort To Bring Back Affirmative Action “Your hair needs attention, it takes up most of the frame and looks ridiculous, personally I don’t think you should be on air,” Hanchard said, quoting the email. Hanchard said black women in the workplace often experience discrimination if they wear their hair naturally. “This legislation is the systemic change required to acknowledge that hairstyles associated with my blackness are not a threat,” Hanchard said. Under federal law, Afros are already considered an ""immutable racial characteristic"" and protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But other hairstyles do not have the same protection. If passed, the bill under consideration in Washington would allow people to file claims with the Human Rights Commission. The executive director of the Commission, Sharon Ortiz, also testified and said it’s not just black people who face hair discrimination. She recalled efforts to assimilate Native American children by placing them in white-run boarding schools beginning in the 1860s. “They were not allowed to speak their language and their hair was cut, their braids were cut. This has left trauma that is still with native people today,” Ortiz said. The anti-discrimination bill has 35 co-sponsors, including two Republicans. During the public hearing, a couple of Republican committee members asked questions about how the law would affect grooming policies imposed by employers. A non-partisan attorney for the committee responded that those policies could still exist, but would have to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. In addition, anyone filing a claim of discrimination would have to show they had suffered disparate treatment or disparate impact.

537,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-03/california-democratic-party-settles-lawsuits-alleging-harassment-discrimination,California Democratic Party settles lawsuits alleging harassment and discrimination by former leader,"The California Democratic Party has reached settlements in three lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and workplace retaliation involving its former leader, Eric Bauman. A statement released by current party Chairman Rusty Hicks on Friday announced the settlements but did not indicate how much the party paid to resolve the legal actions. “Some of the California Democratic Party’s most sacred values are fairness, respect and dignity for all,” Hicks said. “Those values empower so many grassroots leaders and activists to devote their time, talent and treasure to our Party’s candidates and causes.” Bauman announced his resignation in November 2018 following a report from The Times that revealed 10 party staff members and political activists had accused him of making crude sexual comments and engaging in unwanted touching or physical intimidation in professional settings. On Friday, Bauman released a statement about the settlements through his attorney, Neal S. Zaslavsky. “I fully concur with CDP Chair Rusty Hicks’ affirmation that some of the Party’s ‘most sacred values are fairness, respect, and dignity for all.,’” Bauman said. “In that spirit, I am pleased that the CDP ‘has reached equitable settlements with’ all parties.” One of the lawsuits was filed in April by William Floyd, who served as Bauman’s assistant from March 2016 until November 2018 and claimed that Bauman performed oral sex on him without his consent on at least three occasions. That same month, a second lawsuit was filed by former party operations director Tina McKinnor, former communications director John Vigna and party activist Spencer Dayton alleging racial discrimination, retaliation, sexual assault and harassment by Bauman, and claiming that the party failed to protect them. The party has agreed to pay more than $1 million to settle that case, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the settlements. A third settlement was reached with Brendan Stepp, a former video editor and field cinematographer for the party who alleged that Bauman made repeated, unwanted sexual advances toward him. The party previously paid $378,348 in legal settlements to former employees Alton Wang, William Rodriguez-Kennedy and Kate Earley, according to campaign finance filings reviewed by The Times in October. The trio originally filed suit last January, alleging a culture of harassment and sexual misconduct that was “well-known and apparently tolerated” by top officials.

539,https://neilwilby.com/2020/01/14/hero-police-officer-sues-chief-constable-over-racial-and-religious-discrimination/,Hero police officer sues chief constable over racial and religious discrimination,"Neil Wilby Media Campaigning journalism On Thursday 16th January, 2020, at the Leeds Employment Tribunal centre, a final hearing into claims of racial and religious discrimination against West Yorkshire Police opened. A serving police sergeant, Umer Saeed, is the claimant. An accomplished individual, with a BSc degree in Business Administration and Management and over 20 years experience as a police officer; a large part of that in specialist roles. The hearing was listed for twelve court days with some highly-charged evidence likely to be heard from the witness box. Cross-examination was set to be a lively affair as WYP’s ‘go-to’ counsel, Olivia Checa-Dover, yet again takes the stage. She has recently represented the police in two other high profile civil court cases, featuring a Bradford doctor, Abdul Rashid (read more here) and a retired police constable, Kerry Perkins (read more here). In the event, the hearing was adjourned and the parties agreed to a judicial mediation process. That process has now broken down and, in the interim period, Sgt Saeed has issued two further claims against his employer alleging victimisation and disability discrimination. Umer Saeed is represented by Rebecca Townsend of Rebian Solicitors and their instructed barrister is Adam Willoughby of Broadway House Chambers. In an extraordinary development, the full extent of a dispute between those two barristers was revealed at a case management hearing held on 14th December, 2020. Both have now recused themselves from the claim. Full details here. As many have done before him, Sgt Saeed alleges that the ‘cover-up’ of discrimination, both against him and others in the force area, goes to the very top of the force’s hierarchy. It is anticipated that around twenty witnesses will give testimony to the tribunal, unless their witness statements are admitted into evidence in the meantime. It is customary in these proceedings for the police to turn up with a small army of lawyers, witnesses and observers, regardless of cost to the taxpaying public. The well-informed might, quite rightly, muse as to why the chief constable did not take steps to compromise the Saeed claim, with its high potential for serious reputational and financial damage to the force. But it may well be that he was overruled by the Police and Crime Commissioner’s highly litigious chief executive, Fraser Sampson. A noted wastrel when public funds are in issue. His wider role also encompasses general counsel to the police, giving him overall control of the force’s legal department. Indeed, from personal experience, I can say that he regards the WYP Head of Legal Services with scarcely concealed disdain. The PCC signs off all cheques for the police, of course, as part of his statutory remit. His office has not responded to a press enquiry on the subject of diversity and inclusion – and how they come to be facing the class, and scale, of allegations made by Sgt Saeed. Interest in the case is, undoubtedly, heightened when one takes into account the standing of Umer Saeed as a nationally known figure in Black and Muslim staff associations. He is Chair of the West Yorkshire Black Police Association, and General Secretary and a Cabinet Member of the National Black Police Association. He is also a trained Police Federation representative and speaks four languages; Arabic, Punjabi, Slovak, Urdu. He joined the police service in June, 1999. In February 2015, he received national prominence when he broke into the kitchen window of a burning house and saved the lives of a mother and two young children in Ireland Wood, Leeds. It was an outstanding act of bravery and Saeed had this to say of his heroism: “The smoke was acrid and I couldn’t breathe but I was focused on finding them and getting them out in one piece. It was quite a disorientating situation with the smoke alarm going off.” His District Commander, Temporary Chief Superintendent Mabs Hussain, quite rightly commended the officer’s work: “PC Saeed clearly displayed the qualities of bravery and professionalism that we so often see from our officers and staff in situations where people are in danger. “He could see this family needed immediate help and his training gave him the confidence to assess the situation and intervene to bring them to safety from a potentially life-threatening situation.” Hussain has since moved onto Greater Manchester Police, in controversial circumstances (read more here), and a well placed source on his old patch tells me he has not sustained that support for his fellow BME officer over Saeed’s discrimination claims. This would surprise few close to the seat of the action at both GMP and WYP, as ‘top brass’ closing ranks at the first sign of trouble for them, either individually or as as a police force, is de rigeur. Indeed, Hussain has been reported recently as claiming that well-evidenced and highly publicised criticism of his present chief constable, Ian Hopkins, by some distance the worst in the country (read more here), constitutes ‘a hate campaign‘. As a footnote, and by way of balance, it should be noted that, back in 2013, Umer Saeed also featured in the high profile Anthony Ramsden case, involving WYP and the thoroughly disgraced Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), following an assault at Leeds United football ground in 2011. A widescale, dishonestly grounded ‘cover-up’ by both the police force and watchdog was, eventually, exposed. A High Court case that followed is now an oft-cited legal authority in police complaints cases. Saeed was one of six Police Support Unit (PSU) officers giving evidence whom the force, and the IPCC, claimed ALL corroborated one another. When disclosure was eventually wrested from WYP, not ONE single statement corroborated ANY other. The judgment (read in full here) did not reflect the full transrcipt of the proceedings which, at very considerable expense, Mr Ramsden took the trouble to obtain. Another demonstration of the seemingly unwritten public policy of at least some of the local judiciary that demands every conceivable accommodation be granted to West Yorkshire Police when determining matters potentially adverse to the public’s confidence in them. No criticism of PC Saeed (as he was then) should be inferred: Even though he was the only officer who admitted striking a member of the public, in the subject area outside the Elland Round ground, with his long baton, and, therefore, the one most likely to have hit Mr Ramsden, his witness statement was easily the most frank, and credible, of the six. I declare a professional interest, having acted as police complaints advocate for Mr Ramsden, and being adjacent to the facts throughout. I also assisted in the placement of widespread local, regional and national media coverage of the case. Over the past ten years there has been persistent, and often very damaging, publicity over the way West Yorkshire Police treats its black and minority ethnic (BME) officers and, on the evidence of some troubling civil court cases, members of the public of colour, too. In May 2009, the Sunday Telegraph published an article following the leaking of a dossier that was highly critical of the force’s notorious Professional Standards Department and their discriminatory handling of complaints against BME’s. This followed a series of accusations from the officials at the local branches of the Police Federation and the National Black Police Association. The WYP talking head was Deputy Chief Constable, David Crompton, later to fall into repeated disgrace as chief constable at beleaguered South Yorkshire Police (read more here). He denied there was a problem. In March 2011, PC Kashif Ahmed had all ten charges against him dismissed by a judge at Bradford Crown Court after revelations about the seriously flawed way officers had investigated the case. HHJ Peter Benson, ruling in his favour to stay the prosecution, found that there was a “very significant irregularity and impropriety at the root of the investigation” and the whole process was “tarnished”. Judge Benson described two police witnesses, Detective Sergeant Penny Morley and Detective Constable Karen Wade who gave evidence in court during Ahmed’s application to dismiss the case, as “evasive.” He went on to say that Morley, who opened a CD document containing privileged contact between Mr Ahmed and his solicitor, had not told the truth. It is beyond incredible that Morley remained a much-favoured officer in WYP’s Professional Standards Department until ‘retiring’ late last year. Her personal friendship with ACC Angela Williams, who has publicly described Morley as ‘wonderful’, enabled her to re-start at WYP as a civilian officer immediately after her warrant card was handed in. Obviously, on this evidence, being called a liar and rubbish at the job, by a circuit judge, is no handicap in the ranks of West Yorkshire Police.  Angela Williams is the force lead on Diversity and Equality. Her Twitter account has now been deleted. Kash Ahmed later issued a civil claim against the police alleging a “witch hunt” against him by the PSD officers, led by another disgraced officer, DCI Steve Bennett (read more here). Having to represent himself in court against the force solicitor, experienced counsel and a small army of officers giving evidence against him, his claim, perhaps understandably, only succeeded in part and he had a sizeable costs award ordered against him. Dr Rashid, whose civil claim is referred to in the second paragraph of this article, is a highly respected professional, of Asian origin, who also claims, with considerable justification, that he was the subject of a “witch hunt” by WYP and that, in the particular circumstances of his case, if he had been a white, middle-class doctor he would not have been subjected to the same degrading, disproportionate, disgraceful treatment. His civil claim was dismissed after a extraordinarily one-sided hearing, but he was recently given permission to appeal the decision of Mr Recorder Nolan QC, by a High Court judge. The hearing of the appeal is presently listed for 13th February, 2020 in the High Court in Leeds. Olivia Checa-Dover unsuccessfully sought to have me removed from the press seats during the Rashid hearing, questioning my accreditation and claiming (unspecified) inaccuracies in the reporting of the case (read in full here). The other two articles flowing from that ten day court hearing stand unchallenged. One exposes a prima facie case of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by six WYP officers (read the damning details here). Miss Checa-Dover also objected, unsuccessfully, to my presence in the press seats at the hearing of the Kerry Perkins claim, telling opposing counsel that I had a “vendetta” against her. Yet another in an increasingly long line of ludicrous and unsubstantiated submissions. Unsurprisingly, that gained no traction, either. Miss Perkins has also robustly appealed the judgment of HHJ Neil Davey QC, whose decision did not appear to reflect what I heard from the press box. Indeed, one might say that Miss Checa-Dover might well have written it for him. Dismissing the remaining parts of the Kashif Ahmed claim against the police, which had included negligence, false imprisonment and theft, HHJ Mark Gosnell said: “I fully accept that Mr Ahmed was convinced in his belief that he had been the victim of a witch hunt, but I consider the officers involved merely carried out their jobs to the best of their ability and were not motivated by any ulterior motive in dealing with the claimant.” West Yorkshire Police then sought to bankrupt the promising young officer, who holds two law degrees and a diploma in policing. Ahmed now works in Bradford as a legal consultant. The genesis of the entire dispute between force and BME officer was over the use of a car parking space behind Millgarth Police Station, in central Leeds, to which DCI Bennett took exception. The same Bennett whom three years earlier had called a junior Asian officer into his office to verbally abuse him, including calling him a c**t, in an attempt to bully the constable into pulling back on an investigation. That action was later to unravel in the conjoined Operations, Lamp and Redhill, into the ex PC Danny Major miscarriage of justice (read more here). An allegation has been made that Bennett perverted the course of justice in an attempt to protect PC Kevin Liston, arguably one of the worst officers to ever wear a police uniform (read more here) and the key witness against Major. After the Ahmed and Danny Major ‘investigations’ (the term is used loosely), in which he was senior investigating officer, Bennett was rewarded with promotion to superintendent. I declare a further interest, insofar as I was the on-record complaints advocate for the Major family betwen 2012 and 2015. A close working colleague of Bennett’s was Chief Superintendent Sarah Brown. In fact, from 2010 to 2011 she was head of WYP’s Professional Standards Department. I had significant dealings with her and found her unreliable and lacking in integrity. Like Bennett, she had also been city commander of Leeds, with its dreadful history of racism, in the earlier part of her career (read more here). Whilst in that role, and under her previous name and rank of Chief Inspector Sarah Sidney, she was at the forefront of a racial discrimination case involving Detective Sergeant Raham Khan that ultimately reached the House of Lords (the senior appellate court in those days) where a damages award to Sgt Khan, upheld in the Court of Appeal, was set aside by three Law Lords. The full judgment can be read here. Put plainly, Khan alleged that Sidney did not promote him on account of his skin colour. A matter she, of course, denied. In March, 2011 a Bradford minority ethnic, Anwar Gillespie (whom I have met in his home), received substantial damages and an apology from WYP after the intervention of specialist police complaints lawyer, Iain Gould (read more here). Whilst racism was not alleged, Mr Gillespie told me at the time that he felt the colour of his skin was a factor in him being singled out for an unprovoked, unwarranted and brutal attack upon him, outside of his home and in front of his neighbours. In June 2012, BBC Radio’s File on 4 reported on alleged widespread and serious racism within WYP. The least impressive of the six serving and former police officers interviewed on the programme was Temporary Chief Constable, John Parkinson. He did little, or nothing, to allay concerns. Of the six officers, past and present, interviewed by the BBC, Parkinson came across as the least impressive. Listen to the full broadcast here. Karma was to visit Ajaz Hussain, who was the force solicitor (later promoted to Legal Services Director) who drove the Raham Khan case all the way to the Lords. In early 2012, there was a reshuffle of the top management in West Yorkshire Police and he lost his job. The roles of Legal Services Director and Force Solicitor (at that time carried out by Mike Percival) both disappeared. A new role was created and Percival was selected to fill it. Hussain then alleged racial discrimination against David Crompton and issued a claim form in the employment tribunal (read more here). The outcome of that claim has never been made public, but it did not pass without controversy and resulted in the suspension of Hussain’s ‘ACPO police friend’, Neil Rhodes, whom at the time was the chief constable of Lincolnshire Police (read more here) and had fallen foul of the duplicity of Fraser Sampson. In 2013, two police whistleblowers opened up a can of worms into how certain aspects of vital police operations were badly run and lives put at risk by their superior officers within West Yorkshire Police. One of those was a minority ethnic. They were both then subjected to a series of detriments in what appeared to be a concerted campaign to humiliate and smear them. Because of the roles that the officers undertook, for at least parts of their careers, it is unwise to do any more than make reference to the tribunal appeal finding, available in the public domain, which forensically sets out the matters in issue (read more here). It does not make pretty reading for WYP. In April, 2014 a Bradford woman of African descent, Oluwatoyin Azeez, was viciously assaulted by a police officer who had unlawfully entered her home on the pretext of checking on her lodger. The force went to the most extraordinary, and sustained, lengths to cover up for the perpetrator, who falsely alleged that he had been asaulted by Ms Azeez. That miscreant officer, instead of being drummed out of the force, didn’t even face a misconduct meeting, let alone a criminal court. But, once more, the intervention of solicitor, Iain Gould, was pivotal. At the end of a bitterly fought three year legal battle – again irregardless of the cost to the public purse – Ms Azeez finally received a substantial damages payment and, much more crucially to her, an apology (read the full harrowing story here). In April 2016, the incumbent chief constable, Dionne Collins, appointed an Asian police constable as the force’s Positive Action Co-Ordinator. The following month Amjad Ditta, a trained firearms officer, was alongside her giving evidence at the Home Affairs Parliamentary Select Committee. Following publication of the Committee’s Inquiry Report, which called for “urgent and radical” action, Collins acknowledged more needed be done to increase diversity and inclusion among the workforce and said she was determined that the organisation should be more representative of its communities. “We are currently recruiting police officers for the first time in five years and this gives us an excellent opportunity to increase our workforce not just by people from black and minority ethnic communities, but from all diverse groups, such as people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual. “The police service has been in the media headlines a lot recently, often for negative reasons. My challenge to people who may be put off by that is, come and find out what West Yorkshire Police is about in 2016. A career with West Yorkshire Police offers genuinely exciting opportunities, but we can only properly serve all our communities by building a truly representative Force and I am determined to do that.” West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson added: “I have worked with the Temporary Chief Constable (Ms Collins) to ensure we are doing all we can to ensure communities are aware of my commitment to equality and diversity within the organisation and in the police service”. Whilst Collins and Burns-Williamson were shamelessly uttering these shallow words, before MP’s and the television cameras, they were jointly, ludicrously and very cynically, frustrating the civil claim of Oluwatoyin Azeez. In reality, and grounded in hard evidence, what West Yorkshire Police is about is lying and covering-up – and the commitment to equality and diversity is an expensive box-ticking sham. Eighteen months after his televised appearance in Parliament, PC Ditta disappeared without trace. With both the force press office and the chief constable refusing to answer my questions regarding his whereabouts or his reason for the removal both from his diversity role and other front line duties. He dramatically re-appeared, over two years later, at Bradford Magistrates Court charged with sexual touching. Supported by his staff association, he is expected to plead not guilty at a plea and trial preparation hearing at the city’s Crown Court on 20th January, 2020. He now answers to the name of Amjad Hussain. In December, 2017 another race and religious discrimination claim against West Yorkshire Police was compromised on the second day of the final hearing. It is assumed that a confidentiality clause was part of the settlement. No others details are available at present, but enquiries are ongoing. Again, this is on the watch of Dionne Collins: On the one hand preaching diversity and inclusion, on the other officers having to go to court as the force continues to discriminate against them.  At least two other WYP BME officers appeared Tribunal with racial discrimination claims during this period. Both were, regrettably, unrepresented and had their claims dismissed. One was yet another Collins favourite, PC Tayyaba Afzal, having designed the force’s specialist niqab headwear for Muslim female officers. The other was an applicant for a role as a Driver Trainer. Dionne Collins was approached for comment. She did not even have the courtesy to acknowledge the communication. In September, 2018, another case involving a BME officer surfaced as an exclusive on this website, later picked up from here by the national press. The officer concerned, C/Supt Tyron Joyce, was also another favourite of the now retired Collins. Joyce was peremptorily removed from his post as Chief Operating Officer at the National Police Air Service, which shares headquarters in Wakefield with West Yorkshire Police, amidst bullying claims. The complaints investigation into the allegations against Joyce was, unsurprisingly given the incompetents that populate the force’s Professional Standards Department, described as ‘a cack-handed debacle’. He also told a junior colleague at the time: “I’ve been in trouble before with PSD. They tried to do my legs, so I have to be careful what I say to staff” (read more here). Joyce does, however, always have a trump card to play: In 2013, after the present chief constable, John Robins, (at the time an assistant chief constable) had recommended him for the Police National Accreditation Course (PNAC) it was said by Robins to Tyron Joyce; “You are now my tick in the diversity box“. That may explain why, at the end of the disciplinary process, Joyce was handed the plum chief supers role within WYP: Commander – Operational Support based at, and in charge of, the entire Carr Gate Complex on the outskirts of Wakefield. I will be reporting from the opening of the Umer Saeed hearing. It promises to be an interesting case: A retired and highly decorated WYP officer told me recently that, whatever the outcome of the tribunal proceedings, the force may well be set back at least a decade in terms of BME recruitment as a result of the adverse publicity the case will attract. As a well-connected person of Asian origin, and one who has defeated WYP in court several times, it is taken as read that he knows exactly what he is talking about. Finally, it should be remembered that the ‘mother’ of all tribunal claims is a West Yorkshire Police case. Angela Vento, a probationer BME officer, took her force to tribunal following serious discrimination against her in the late 1990’s. Her claim form pleaded racial and sexual discrimination, but the former allegation was dismissed at an early stage by the tribunal. Eventually the Court of Appeal ruled on the matter and the framework for tribunal awards – and the scales of damages accounting for different levels of detriment – is still in use today. Albeit, the figures have been adjusted upwards to reflect inflation. For the legal nerds amongst my readers they may wish to check out the full CoA judgment (read here).

Aberdeen Taexali Rugby Club, which is the first in the area to promote itself as being inclusive for for gay, straight, bisexual and trans men received the boost from property firm Cala Homes. The club has used the cash to buy new jerseys and branded team kits, new branded rugby balls and additional training equipment. Club treasurer, Stephen Williamson, said: “Ever since the founding of our club, we have aimed to be a pillar of support for the LGBT community in Aberdeen, offering an all-inclusive and welcoming group of like-minded people. “We hope to continue to do this through even more support from the community and through competitive play and tournament events which stand for tolerance in sports.” The club is the first team to represent the north-east of Scotland as part of the International Gay Rugby (IGR) community and has pioneered a tolerant and accepting way for anyone to become involved in the sport without discrimination. Mike Naysmith, managing director at Cala Homes North, said: “The work carried out by the team at Aberdeen Taexali Rugby Club is simply remarkable, not only for the LGBT community in the region, but for the sport in general.” Already a subscriber?

The amendment was included in the Comprehensive CREDIT Act (H.R. 3621), which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 221-to-189. “Credit scores impact our lives in so many ways – from rates on car loans and mortgages to whether you get hired or can find a place to live. Credit reporting agencies, however, are notoriously under-regulated and unaccountable to consumers,” said Congressman DeSaulnier. “With credit being so important, we have to take the next step to get to the bottom of how inaccuracies come up and how they can cause negative repercussions now and in the future.” The Comprehensive CREDIT Act addresses America’s outdated, broken, and mistake-riddled credit reporting system. Congressman DeSaulnier’s amendment would require the non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the ways in which credit scores are weaponized to discriminate against borrowers and segregate communities along racial and economic lines. Congress last enacted comprehensive reform of the credit reporting system over 15 years ago.

This is headed to banning the use of credit reports in tenant applicant checks. Oakland, among other citadels of great government, already wants to ban the use of criminal background checks. Next, I suppose, will come banning the use of income verification. And California’s liberals continue to worship the idol of rental controls. It doesn’t take a PhD to realize that all this is further incentive for owners to withdraw rental properties from the market and further disincentive to build new housing. Then, of course, we will hear wailing anew about the the lack of “affordable housing.” The idea that government can control housing markets more efficiently than the market is a mirage. Absolutely right Robert. But politicians (in particular the dems) don’t give a damm whether or not anything they do works. They just put it on their resume that they did something to look good. In this case, he got another press article which is positive about him. You’re right! The important thing is to look like you’re doing something and appeal to your chosen special interests, isn’t it? The Democrats pulled the sub prime loan scheme before…. I remember Bush warning Congress 17 times that it would be a disaster but they all ignored him & then blamed Bush when things went Kablooey! just like he said it would…. and all those people who weren’t qualified lost their homes. Dem’s rolled their eyes, whistled and walked away. Let us review: The housing bubble that burst in late 2007 and early 2008 was created by what? Greed? What did this greed look like? Banks repackaged subprime mortgages and rated them high quality when they were in fact very poor. How poor? The people acquired the property with little regard to credit score, criminal history, wage, and appraisals of the properties. All under the mirage the banks are more concerned about racism and forgot about solid financial decisions. Mark you are a terrible politician for not learning from history. Comments are closed.

647,https://thefulcrum.us/voting/mike-bloomberg,Ending voting discrimination key to Bloomberg reform plan,"The former New York mayor, above talking to reporters this week, is the last presidential candidate to detail his plan for fixing the system's ills. Citizens would be automatically registered to vote, or they could register online or on Election Day, under a comprehensive voting rights proposal unveiled Friday by Mike Bloomberg. He is the last of the prominent Democratic candidates for president to detail an agenda for making the democratic process work better. The plan was unveiled as Bloomberg took his campaign to Georgia for an appearance with Stacey Abrams, one of the most prominent civil rights advocates in the country. ""The right to vote is the fundamental right that protects all others, but in states around the country it is under attack,"" Bloomberg said in a statement released by his campaign. Among several other elements, the plan by the billionaire media company owner and former New York City mayor would: The package embraces all of the major voting proposals included in HR 1, the election and ethics overhaul the Democratic-controlled House passed last year. The Republican-controlled Senate has no interest in the legislation. All of the other Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed the voting rights provisions in that bill. Bloomberg was scheduled to appear with Abrams at an Atlanta summit held Friday by her political action and voting rights group Fair Fight 2020, which she created after narrowly losing her 2018 bid to become the nation's first black female governor. Bloomberg last year gave $5 million to the group, which amounts to almost a quarter of its fundraising to date.  Sign up for The Fulcrum newsletter Abrams alleges that voting irregularities in 2018 included rejection of thousands of would-be voters at the polls because of minor discrepancies between their registration forms and other records. The Bloomberg campaign's announcement touted that the ""centerpiece of Mike's plan is a series of initiatives designed to tackle racial disparity in voting rights."" Eight percent of black adults are blocked from voting, it said, because of past convictions, which is four times the rate for other Americans. The announcement also noted that 36 states require voters to show some sort of ID before casting their ballots, which disproportionately prevents members of minority groups from getting to vote. To deal with discrimination in voting, Bloomberg also proposed restoring the Voting Rights Act requirement of preapproval for any changes in areas with a history of discrimination and creating a nonpartisan commission to set federal standards for voting in federal elections to eliminate disparities across states, including voter ID requirements. There will be no in-person explanation of his proposals at the next presidential debate, in Des Moines on Tuesday, because Bloomberg's decision to bankroll his own campaign rather than raise small-dollar donations from others has resulted in his not being invited. He is not contesting Iowa or the other early caucus and primary states but is instead investing heavily on winning delegates after that. Georgia's primary is March 24.

655,https://brainlessblogger.net/2020/01/27/what-is-ableism/,What is Ableism?,"Brainless Blogger You may have heard people talk about Ableism. I often talk about stigma and discrimination but haven’t used the term itself but it is the term. Like sexism, ageism and racism, ableism is a form of discrimination against disabled people by those who are not.  type of discrimination in which able-bodied individuals are viewed as normal and superior to those with a disability, resulting in prejudice toward the latter. Discrimination against disabled persons occurs in countries worldwide and may be reflected in individual, societal, and institutional attitudes and norms and in the arrangement or dynamics of certain environments. Indeed, interpretations of ableism are based on perspectives of what constitutes normal ability, which often gives shape to beliefs and norms and to physical and social environments. As a result, those affected by physical, mental, or emotional impairments tend to be in the minority and may be treated differently from their normal peers. Disabled persons may experience labeling, altered expectations, and discrimination in the context of eugenics. Those factors can cause disabled persons to view ableism, rather than their impairments, as their primary barrier to community participation. Britannica …analogous to racism, sexism or ageism, [and] sees persons with disabilities as being less worthy of respect and consideration, less able to contribute and participate, or of less inherent value than others. Ableism may be conscious or unconscious, and may be embedded in institutions, systems or the broader culture of a society. It can limit the opportunities of persons with disabilities and reduce their inclusion in the life of their communities Ontario Human Rights Commission “People with mental illnesses are more prone to violent behaviour.” When in fact the level of violence with mental illnesses is equivalent to the general population. Due to various negative stereotypes, people may be afraid to disclose their disability. “They may worry about being labelled, experiencing negative attitudes from others, losing their jobs or housing, or experiencing unequal treatment in services after disclosing a mental health issue or addiction. Fear of discrimination can also result in people not seeking support for a mental health issue or addiction. Negative attitudes, stereotyping and stigma can also lead to harassment towards people with psychosocial disabilities in the form of negative comments, social isolation and unwanted conduct (including mental health profiling) from employers, landlords, co-workers or service providers. ” Ontario Human Rights Commission ‘Crazy’, ‘Lame’, ‘Insane’, ‘retarded’. So often words are used flippantly. Carelessly. But it isn’t so flippant to someone it effects. And it can be used rather sharp and directly. I once heard someone who had Major Depressive Disorder in the workplace as ‘crazy’ and ‘insane’… not so cool then is it? Not when I heard it and was fighting depression myself and wouldn’t ever admit to it for years as a result of the stigma I knew existed. Nor would I seek treatment due to that stigma. So maybe words do have some power, eh? “When a critique of language that makes reference to disability is not welcome, it is nearly inevitable that, as a disabled person, I am not welcome either,” Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg wrote in a 2013 Disability and Representation article. But beyond individual feelings, ableist language can contribute to a foundation of more systemic oppression of people with disabilities as a group. “If a culture’s language is full of pejorative metaphors about a group of people,” Cohen-Rottenberg continued, that culture is more likely to view those individuals as less entitled to rights like “housing, employment, medical care, education, access, and inclusion as people in a more favored group.” Mic The best example of a healthy person privilege is using a disabled parking space or handicapped bathroom stall… like they have the right to. Because they are used to all space being available to them then why not use spaces allocated to the disabled… just for a second, not like it matters, not like it isn’t literally taking an available space from someone who may need it. When space availability isn’t something disabled people have in abundance… there are limitations. If there are no ramps, that isn’t accessible as it should be is it? If we cannot take the stairs we must have an elevator… so if your public bathroom is downstairs and you have no elevator… that isn’t very accessible is it? So we have limitations on spaces we can use and places we can be. To use the allotted spaces for disabled people is abusing your privilege. Back to the disabled parking spots… how many disabled people have been yelled at or gotten nasty notes on their car because some healthy person Assumes they are not disabled enough to use a disabled parking stall? It is a lot more than you would think. It happens a Lot. My best example was asking for accommodation at a workplace and being told I didn’t have a disability (fibromyalgia and chronic migraines) and therefore they wouldn’t accommodate me. I knew they meant I didn’t have a Visible Disability. All I wanted was an ergonomically adjusted office and better lighting. That’s all. Or maybe work flexibility… which they gave to others but never me… because not disabled enough I guess. “So… why do you use that cane?” I get that one a lot. Because people feel like they have the right to ask. I have the right to give any random answer I want as a result. Anyway, feeling like you have the right to know how or why someone is disabled is not cool. It is intrusive. Unless we mention it. Or want to talk about it. Expect sarcastic responses… because we are allowed to have Some fun with it the 100th time we get asked. Disabled person does a normal thing. WOW. OMG. The fact you can DO that and Be Disabled is SOOOooooo Inspirational to us all!!!! Ah, what the what? “At least it isn’t cancer.” “A lot of people are worse off than you.” “At least your not on fire.” “At least your not dead or anything.” You are invalidating and diminishing the experience of the person. And it is cruel. “You’re looking for attention.” “You’re abusing the system.” “You’re faking it.” “You’re just lazy.” “You caused this yourself.” “You’re not trying hard enough.” “You must be doing something wrong to have ended up that way.” “Clearly its because of your lifestyle.” “Hey, just change your mindset and change your life! Just be more positive… blah blah” “You’re just mentally weak” “You’re exaggerating.” You either assume they are childlike and lesser intelligence. Or you talk to their caregiver automatically instead of addressing them directly. Or you treat them as if they are less able to do things for themselves. Invisible disabilities are seen as less severe. Often more doubted. Because there is nothing to point to its severity… must not be as bad as they say. Just exaggerating. With this comes the whole ‘oh you did a thing you must be better’ or ‘oh you smiled and laughed you must be faking’. Because they cannot work they are considered less valuable to society. And you see them as less valuable as a person. And besides so and so with a disability works, why can’t you be like them… productive? Is a slightly different term: The term ‘disablism’ describes negative beliefs and discrimination based on disability, focusing on the societal oppression faced by people with disabilities. Miller et al. (2004) define disablism as “discriminatory, oppressive, or abusive behavior arising from the belief that disabled people are inferior to others” (p. 28). People with disabilities experience disablism when they are excluded from participating in society through various types of barriers, when they are viewed as objects of pity, or when they are exhorted to overcome their disability. Disablism can occur at different levels. Individual-level disablism involves personal negative beliefs that individuals have about people with disabilities. Institutional disablism refers to the development of societal structures or institutional practices that leads to the systematic exclusion of people with disabilities. This can lead to additional social and physical barriers for people with disabilities. Some have critiqued the term disablism for placing the focus on the person with the disability or disability itself, rather than the discriminator or the act of discrimination (Harpur, 2009). Nonetheless, disablism is the preferred term for disability-related discrimination among many disability advocates, and is the term of choice in Great Britain. While the terms ableism and disablism have slightly different meanings, both terms convey an understanding of the types of societal discrimination that people with disabilities experience based on negative views toward people with disabilities. (Science Direct- dead link) That is the basic idea behind Ablism which we all have experienced in some form or another. There are many other examples out there. It is stigma. It is discrimination. It is casual. It direct. It is the public, medical field and institutions and workplaces. Ranging from mild to severe in impact on the lives of the disabled person.

The bill filed by state Sen. Tonya Anderson, a Democrat representing Lithonia, would protect people who have “braids, locks, twists, or other textured hairdressing historically associated with an individual’s race,” news outlets reported. Violators could face lawsuits, civil fines or penalties, WXIA-TV reported. Similar legislation has been passed in California, New York and New Jersey, according to news outlets. State Sen. Nikema Williams, an Atlanta Democrat, said she’s working with Anderson on the bill. Williams told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that a House member approached her after she removed her braids and had her hair pressed straight during the 2019 legislative session. “She thought she was complimenting me and told me how much more professional I looked without my braids in,” Williams said. “She told me ‘keep your hair like that, it looks so much better like that.’” Williams said she told the House member she planned to get braids again because the style was healthier for her hair. “Our hair is an expression of who we are and conforming is almost no longer the norm,” Anderson said. ©2015 - 2021 90.1 FM WABE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bank said in a tweet posted Tuesday that it has told program officials it will ""not be contributing again until more inclusive policies have been adopted by all participating schools to protect the sexual orientation of all our students."" Florida's Tax Credit Scholarship lets companies make tax-deductible contributions that fund vouchers to private schools for low-income students. The program sparked backlash following an Orlando Sentinel investigation that found 83 of 1,000 private religious schools, which accepted the vouchers, had anti-LGBTQ policies, including banning students from attending the schools or expel them for their sexual orientation. The newspaper also found that another 73 schools labeled being gay and transgender as a sin but didn't explain how the views ""play out in admissions or student discipline decisions,"" it said. The Sentinel said Fifth Third donated $5.4 million last year. Fifth Third Bank didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment. ""We definitely stand with #LGBTQ students and parents,"" the bank said in a tweet. Other companies with policies supporting the LGBTQ community also have donated to the program, including Geico ($7 million) and United Healthcare ($15 million), according to the newspaper's research. Rosen Hotels, a small hospitality chain in Orlando, recently pulled its support of the program. Representative Carlos Guillermo-Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, criticized Fifth-Third Bank for its contributions, but he applauded the bank's decision on his Twitter account.

Jennifer McDowell, 45, who for nearly two years served as Mercy's director of radiology, alleged in a lawsuit filed Nov. 19 in Linn County District Court that the hospital permitted several male medical officials to 'undermine, disrespect and demean” her based on her gender, then fired her in retaliation over her complaints. Mercy Medical has not yet formally responded to the litigation. In an emailed statement Wednesday, Mercy Medical spokeswoman Karen Vander Sanden said the hospital 'firmly (denies) these claims and (believes) they will be found meritless.” 'Mercy has a long history of commitment to providing a respectful, inclusive and equal workplace, including providing fair compensation and benefits regardless of gender,” she wrote. 'Mercy has worked, and will continue to work, in a manner consistent with the highest standards of individual and organizational integrity while meeting all ethical and legal standards.” Vander Sanden said the Iowa Civil Rights Commission had reviewed the case and administratively closed it without pursuing further action. The commission issued McDowell a 'right-to-sue” letter to pursue the case in District Court, per her lawsuit. The suit on Tuesday was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. McDowell seeks an undetermined sum from Mercy Medical, in excess of $75,000, in connection with an alleged violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Among the issues in the lawsuit, McDowell says when interviewing for her position in October 2016, she reportedly was asked several gender-based questions, including whether she had children and if her husband would move with her if she were offered the job. McDowell's attorneys wrote that she learned in May 2018 she was paid less than her male predecessor by approximately $30 per hour, or $62,000 annually, despite being assigned more responsibilities - including overseeing construction of a new facility, coordinating two organizational shifts and managing five departments, compared to her predecessor's four. McDowell's supervisor allegedly told her the disparity was a result of different job titles, despite the same job description, and seniority - explanations the lawsuit alleges are inconsistent with Mercy Medical's policies and practices. Mercy Medical placed McDowell on unpaid administrative leave and was fired in August 2018 for conduct she never had been warned about. Details were not included in the lawsuit. McDowell had not faced any previous disciplinary or performance issues. But an anonymous hotline complaint made against her the previous month prompted Mercy to investigate 'with rigor” and ask employees gender-based questions, the lawsuit said. McDowell's lawsuit seeks past and future wages and lost benefits, damages for emotional distress, attorney's fees and equitable relief - including but not limited to court-ordered gender bias training at Mercy Medical.

860,https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2020/01/town-insists-theres-no-discrimination-problem-as-it-pays-out-500k-settlement.html,Town insists there’s no discrimination problem as it pays out $500K settlement,"The Wall Township Committee agreed to settle a discrimination suit by an Indian-American former police officer for $500,000.Steve Strunsky |NJ Advance Media for NJ.com With another discrimination suit still pending, Wall Township and its insurance company will pay $500,000 to settle a lawsuit by an Indian-American former police officer who says he was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his race. In what Wall’s business administrator insisted was strictly a business decision, the township committee on Wednesday night unanimously approved a resolution authorizing the settlement with the former officer, Suresh Madhavan. Madhavan’s was one of two discrimination suits filed against the township in 2018 in state Superior Court, both alleging racial discrimination and a hostile work environment within the police department. The other, by a police dispatcher now suspended without pay, Nicholas Curcio, is still pending. Both suits were filed only months after Wall and its insurer reached a $1.25 million settlement of a discrimination suit filed against the township by a former tax clerk, Brandon Jacobs, who said he was ridiculed about his Jewish faith. Critics have accused township officials of tolerating a toxic culture of hate, resulting in lawsuits that, despite liability insurance, nonetheless end up costing taxpayers big money, an assertion officials have denied. Madhavan, a 13-year veteran of the Wall Township Police Department before his departure in 2016, alleged in the suit that he had been subjected to verbal and other harassment because of his race, including being called the N-word, made to perform menial tasks around police headquarters, and having a second officer accompany him on patrol. Madhavan was forced out of the department in 2016 on what he alleged in the suit were trumped up disciplinary charges despite an otherwise spotless record. Curcio, who is white, alleged in his suit that he was called a “monkey” and the N-word because of discolorations of his leg related to his diabetes. He says the department likewise trumped up charges against him, and he has been suspended without pay since 2016. Last year, a Monmouth County jury took an hour to acquit Curcio of related criminal charges accusing him of harassing a fellow department employee. Madhavan did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. His lawyer, Jeffrey Downs, would have no comment on the settlement until it was signed by all the parties, which had not happened as of Friday, Downs’ office said. Wall Township Administrator Jeff Bertrand said the committee’s unanimous vote to settle the Madhavan case was strictly a financial decision, based on the recommendation of the township’s insurance carrier, Summit Risk Services of Horsham, Pennsylvania. Bertrand said Summit will pay 80% of the settlement amount, or $400,000, while the township will pay the remaining $100,000. Asked whether the settlement was an indication that Madhavan’s allegations were true, Bertrand replied, “absolutely not.” “The insurance company said that they believe the ongoing cost of litigation to them was excessive,” Bertrand said. Had the township insisted on trying the case and lost, Bertrand said, it might have been forced to pay a larger share of whatever amount was awarded to Madhavan. Summit did not respond to requests for comment. Curcio’s lawsuit is now in the discovery phase, though his lawyer, Ravi Sattiraju, predicted a trial would be scheduled for sometime this year — unless the case is settled. Sattiraju said the settlement of the Madhavan case was telling. “This settlement is part of an ongoing problem in Wall Township, where they were not mindful of their obligations under employment laws or respect for people,” Sattiraju said. “They’re going to are repercussions.” Bertrand rejected the assertion there was any ongoing problem in Wall. He insisted that expressions of hate or bias are not tolerated and that police and civilian employees have undergone sensitivity training. He also noted that the two police chiefs who had been in office during the period described by Madhavan and Curcio were no longer with the department. “The town has looked inward,” Bertrand said. “We’re being painted as a racist community. We’re being painted as a racist department. That’s not true. That’s not true at all. We have very good officers. People in the police department are not judged by their physical attributes. They’re judged by their ability to do their jobs, by their morals, and by their professionalism.” Steve Strunsky may be reached at sstrunsky@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @SteveStrunsky.

864,https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2020/01/31/rockland-and-hi-tor-shelter-hit-discrimination-suit/4621739002/,Rockland and Hi Tor shelter hit with discrimination suit,"Two former workers have filed a discrimination lawsuit against members of Hi Tor Animal Care Center's Board of Directors and the County of Rockland, which owns the land and building where the nonprofit shelter is located. The lawsuit, filed by former shelter employees James Joseph and Michael Sanducci, claims racial discrimination against Joseph by board member Steven Harris and retaliatory wrongful termination of Sanducci, who claims he was fired because he stood up for Joseph. Besides Harris, Hi Tor Board President Debbie DiBernardo is named in the suit, which was filed in late January in State Supreme Court in New City. It seeks unspecified damages, compensation and lawyers fees. Kevin Shehan, Hi-Tor Animal Care Center’s lawyer, said on Friday that the shelter cannot comment on employee matters or pending litigation. The suit alleges that Hi Tor board member Steven Harris targeted Joseph with racially insensitive remarks, such as saying Joseph and a black pitbull-type dog looked so similar they ""could be brothers."" He is also alleged to have said that Harris, as the shelter's only black employee, appeared to know how to ""hotwire a car"" after the worker was able to repair a stalled generator. The suit claims that Sanducci, along with Joseph and unspecified Hi Tor volunteers, went to the County of Rockland offices in New City to complain about the environment on Oct. 25, 2018. Sanducci was terminated on Nov. 3, 2018, the lawsuit claims, ""for unlawful discrimination and retaliation."" CUOMO BRIDGE ART: 8 New Yorkers' works will grace Tappan Zee crossing GRADUATION VS. FALL SPORTS: Which will be pushed for South field fix? LOSS: Teen worked 2 jobs, took classes in hopes of a better life Hi Tor said at the time that Sanducci, the shelter's manager/director, was fired for job abandonment. In the wake of his firing, some volunteers left. Others returned to the shelter, which takes in about 2,000 animals a year and contracts with Rockland municipalities to handle strays. ""There are no allegations of unlawful conduct by the County or its employees in the complaint,"" Rockland County Attorney Thomas Humbach said in a statement Friday. ""The County of Rockland will be filing a motion with the court to dismiss the case against the County."" The lawsuit cites the county's support of Hi Tor and its ownership of the property. Rockland Executive Ed Day has championed the nonprofit animal shelter, which has struggled for years to build its finances and manage the dilapidated county-owned space. Day negotiated higher fees from municipalities that use the shelter's services and provided space for cats at the shuttered Sain Building amid a ringworm outbreak among cats. Day gave his budget presentation at Hi Tor on Oct. 2, 2019, in which he announced further county investment in the facility. The county is currently seeking bids to build a new shelter on county-owned land adjacent to the current facility. Humbach said the county would offer no further comments. As part of the Jan. 29 court filing, lawyer William O. Wagstaff III included a copy of a termination agreement that offered Sanducci $6,000 in exchange for his promise not to make any ""derogatory, negative or disparaging statement"" about Hi Tor, nor sue the shelter. Sanducci did not sign it.

867,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/01/28/bill-targets-discrimination-based-on-natural-hairstyles,Bill Targets Discrimination Based On Natural Hairstyles,"Boston City Council President Kim Janey said the first time her great aunt straightened her hair was when she was a three-year-old flower girl at a wedding in 1968. Her father was livid, she said, as the new hairdo was a rejection of black pride in his eyes. ""This was my first introduction to the debate on black girls and women and how we should wear our hair,"" Janey said during a Joint Committee on the Judiciary hearing Tuesday. ""This tension between natural hair that is free from chemical relaxers versus hairstyles that affirm our blackness."" Janey, along with Councilor Lydia Edwards, Rep. Steven Ultrino (D-Malden) and other advocates, attended a committee hearing Tuesday to lobby for a proposal (H 4295) that would prohibit discrimination based on natural hairstyles. Ultrino, the lead sponsor of the bill, said he doesn't file legislation unless it addresses a topic that could be detrimental to his constituents. ""Two of the students in my district, black students, were told that their hairstyles violated the school's dress code and they were treated unfairly because they refused to comply with this policy,"" Ultrino said. ""Though the school has changed their policy per the direction of the Attorney General, this form of discrimination is still pervasive across many aspects in business and in schools."" A series of states have passed legislation banning hair discrimination in one form or fashion. California took the lead on July 3, 2019, and New York followed suit several days later. New Jersey passed a law in December. The Massachusetts bill states that natural hairstyles are physical traits ""central to individual dignity, autonomy, and personhood,"" and targeting an individual's natural hair and hairstyle connected to their race would be racial discrimination, under the bill. Prejudice towards African American students, employees, and individuals participating in public accommodations as a result of their hair texture and nature in which it grows and is styled would be illegal discrimination, the bill states. Examples of illegal discrimination include a public or private school that prohibits ""locs or braids,"" and prevents black student-athletes from participating in competition because hair is below their shoulders ""but allows white student-athletes with long hair to tie it up,"" according to the bill. The legislation also includes a clause allowing the attorney general to pursue a civil action for ""injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief in order to protect the exercise of rights secured in this act."" The creation of the bill stems from incidents constituents brought up to Ultrino including a months-long dispute in May 2017 between the Cook family of Malden and Mystic Valley Regional Charter School in Malden. Parents Aaron and Deanna Cook said their daughters went to school with box braids, which at the time were against school uniform and dress code policies. They received daily detentions and uniform infractions for their hairstyles. Aaron Cook said he thought a simple meeting would fix the issue but instead he and his wife were ""completely stonewalled"" by the school. Attorney General Maura Healey eventually sent a letter in May 2017 to the school asking them cease enforcing or imposing discipline for violation of the uniform and dress code. The legislation, Aaron Cook said, helps break down the barrier for African American people so communities do not need to fight a discriminatory view of hair. ""Our children were presented with a choice: conform to the discriminatory policy and don't make any waves about it, or fight for what we as a family felt was right and just and ensure that the policy was changed,"" Aaron Cook said during Tuesday's hearing. ""It is that imperative workplaces and schools are educated and informed about natural hairstyles, and the adverse impact that discrimination has against people choosing to wear their hair natural and protected.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
903,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-fesser-black-man-racial-discrimination-work-boss-police-wrongful-arrest-settlement-2020-02-12/,"Racial discrimination: A black man reported discrimination at work to his boss. Then his boss asked the police to arrest him. Now, he's getting $600,000.","Watch CBSN Live By Sophie Lewis February 12, 2020 / 7:15 PM / CBS News In 2017, Michael Fesser confided in his boss that he was facing racial discrimination at work. Then, his boss called in a personal favor to the local police department, asking them to arrest Fesser before he could sue the company. Fesser — a 48-year-old black man who formerly worked for a towing company in Portland, Oregon — was awarded a $600,000 settlement this week for his wrongful arrest, the West Linn Police Department announced Tuesday. That's in addition to $415,000 paid to Fesser by his former boss and former company in 2018 for racial discrimination, The Oregonian reports. According to court documents, West Linn Police Chief Terry Timeus ordered two sergeants to build a case against Fesser in 2017, after he told his boss about the discrimination. The officers ultimately arrested and detained Fesser for allegedly stealing money from A&B Towing, his former employer. ""They started out by trying to assassinate my character,"" Fesser told CBS Portland, Oregon, affiliate KOIN-TV. Timeus was allegedly doing a favor for Fesser's boss, Eric Benson, who believed Fesser planned to sue him for racial discrimination. According to court documents provided to CBS News by Fesser's lawyer, Fesser said employees at the company called him racist slurs and taunted him with a Confederate flag. The West Linn Police Department recorded audio of Fesser at work without a warrant or court order. They arrested him on felony charges without probable cause and seized his cash, phone and documents alleging racial discrimination at the company — all without a search warrant. Case records also show a slew of racist and crude text messages between the police department and Fesser's boss, KOIN reports. The officers never found any evidence of wrongdoing by Fesser while surveilling him. While the City of West Linn agreed to settle the suit, the police department said the decision ""is not an admission of liability,"" but rather ""seeks to avoid additional expense, uncertainty, and drain on public resources."" ""As we move forward, the West Linn Police Department strives to learn from both our past mistakes and our successes,"" West Linn Police said in a statement. Fesser's lawyer, Paul Buchanan, said he's happy with the settlement, but hopes the police department will reevaluate its policies moving forward. ""The pattern of police misconduct and racism by West Linn Police officers, facilitated by the Portland Police, is truly shocking and disheartening,"" Buchanan told CBS News on Wednesday. ""We hope that our local police will take the very strong local and national reaction we are seeing to this case as a strong message that reform is required."" ""It is scary that the police can so readily make up claims that are not true,"" Buchanan said. Fesser reportedly took legal action to ensure a situation like this does not happen to another black man, including his two teenage sons. He now volunteers at a local prison and runs an organization that helps men transition out of prison — and he said he's ready to move on from the incident. ""What's really going to help is if we come together as a community and their community also and we just move through this process so it doesn't happen again,"" he said. ""This cannot happen. It has to stop."" First published on February 12, 2020 / 7:15 PM © 2020 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

948,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51620990,Cardiff woman wins £400k in DWP race discrimination row,"By Rianna CroxfordBBC News The Department for Work and Pensions has been ordered to pay out nearly £400,000 after a Cardiff woman won her claim for race and age discrimination. Anne Giwa-Amu told the BBC the department was ""promoting a culture of racism"". The judge in her tribunal case said she had been a victim of deliberate and intended harassment by DWP staff. The department said racism was unacceptable and it took the judgement ""very seriously"". Warning: This report includes racist and offensive language Anne Giwa-Amu, 59, who is mixed Nigerian and Welsh, joined the DWP branch in Caerphilly as a full-time administrative officer in 2017, after trying without success to start a small business. She was the only non-white recruit and only trainee over the age of 50 in her cohort, according to documents from Cardiff Magistrates' Court seen by BBC News. Judge Howden-Evans said DWP staff had deliberately created a ""hostile environment"" for Ms Giwa-Amu and has ordered the department to pay out more than £386,000 in compensation. This includes £42,800 for injury to feelings, which is awarded in the ""most serious"" cases where there has been a lengthy campaign of harassment. ""It comes as a relief after what has been a harrowing experience for three years,"" Ms Giwa-Amu told the BBC. ""I've had to experience real financial hardship and the perpetrators were promoted despite how they had treated me."" A DWP official had violated her dignity by using racist language such as ""Paki-lover"" in her presence, the court found. Another had further humiliated and discriminated against Ms Giwa-Amu by loudly laughing and telling her cohort he had ""touched her bum"". Officials had also repeatedly accused Ms Giwa-Amu of stealing ice-cream, sprayed body-spray on themselves while next to her, and breached her confidence after she reported feeling ""bullied"". Ms Giwa-Amu went on sick leave in March 2017 and was unlawfully dismissed in October that year for being unable to return to work, the court found. She had been living off £55 a week and later had no money for food after her final pay cheque was withheld. Ms Giwa-Amu told the BBC she has since been living with ""immense stress and anxiety"". ""Management at the DWP are paying lip service to the equality legislation,"" she said. ""By protecting offenders, they are promoting a culture of racism."" The DWP has been ordered to contact the Equality and Human Rights Commission for diversity awareness training and its permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, must directly review her case. Ms Giwa-Amu's solicitor, Lawrence Davies from Equal Justice, said DWP staff had ""set out to destroy the confidence and wellbeing of a black employee with their appalling conduct"". ""None of the white DWP staff have been disciplined and some have been promoted,"" he said. ""Given that the DWP serves a high level of ethnic minority claimants, the presence of prejudice in the state benefits system is of grave concern."" In a statement, the DWP said: ""Racism is totally unacceptable and action will be taken against any staff found to be expressing such views. ""We take the judgement and the circumstances of this case very seriously.""

1111,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/risky-unrealistic-mps-hit-back-at-call-to-ditch-religious-discrimination-bill-20200213-p540i8.html,Religious discrimination: MPs hit back at Fierravanti-Wells' call to ditch bill,"We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago Coalition MPs and church leaders have dismissed a call for the government's religious discrimination bill to be scrapped, with the chair of the committee set to review it warning ""we should not let perfect be the enemy of the good"". Senior Liberal backbencher Concetta Fierravanti-Wells this week said the Morrison government should ditch the controversial bill in favour of a new anti-discrimination framework because it was too ""flawed"" and religious leaders continued to raise ""serious concerns"". Queensland government senator Amanda Stoker has warned against abandoning a proposed religious discrimination bill. Credit:Edwina Pickles But several government MPs dismissed Senator Fierravanti-Wells' idea on Thursday, saying a consolidated framework of all anti-discrimination laws was ""unrealistic"" and ""risky"". Victorian Liberal and free speech advocate James Paterson said he was ""completely opposed to abandoning an almost complete religious freedom process in favour of a wildly ambitious and risky project to consolidate all anti-discrimination law"". Senator Paterson, who sits on the government's backbench committee that will look at the bill before it is taken to the Coalition party room, added it would take ""years"" to get a national anti-discrimination law framework and ""the final product is almost certain to be inferior"". Queensland senator Amanda Stoker, who chairs the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that will examine the bill once it is introduced to Parliament, agreed a consolidation project was ""unrealistic"" and a ""long way off"". The former barrister, who spoke of freedom of religion in her first speech to Parliament, added: ""If we want to level the playing field in discrimination law for people of faith, then we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good"". ""The freedom of a person to think, speak and act in accordance with their religious belief is meaningfully protected by the current form of the bill, and will help stop them being bullied into silence in the manner experienced in recent times,"" she said. She stressed ""every single human should be treated with tolerance and respect - that includes religious people and the LGBTIQ+ people who least like the bill"". Liberal MP Tim Wilson, a former human rights commissioner, pointed to the Gillard government's failed bid to overhaul anti-discrimination law in 2013. ""After years of work, Labor's attempt to consolidate all anti-discrimination laws collapsed under the weight of its own complexity and its attempt to advance a culture of censorship over offensive speech,"" Mr Wilson said. A second draft of the religious discrimination bill was released just before Christmas after wide-ranging criticism from community, business and religious groups – with some saying the first bill gave religious Australians too many protections and others wanting more. A coalition of religious leaders, who threatened in November to withdraw their support for the bill unless greater freedoms were granted for Australians of faith, recently wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison in response to the second draft. Sources close to the group say the letter suggests further refinements to the bill but does not contemplate abandoning the process. On Thursday, Bishop Michael Stead from the Sydney Anglican Diocese said there had been ""significant improvements"" between the first and second drafts. ""I think that suggests we should keep going with the process,"" he said, while noting issues remained, such as the need for more clarity around the definition of a ""religious body"" that would qualify for protections. The Uniting Church in Australia has been highly critical of the bill, warning it gives churches too many rights over vulnerable groups, such as LGBTIQ people and Australians with disability. But its president, Dr Deidre Palmer, said the Uniting Church wanted to keep ""constructively"" engaging with the government on the bill. ""This is still a live conversation for us to have,"" she said. Public submissions on the second draft of the bill closed at the end of January. Attorney-General Christian Porter has said ""sensible"" issues have been raised in the thousands of submissions received. He is planning another ""brief"" round of consultations before the bill comes to Parliament. Judith Ireland is a former political reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.

1231,https://www.wpr.org/gender-discrimination-complaint-filed-against-uw-eau-claire-administrator,Gender Discrimination Complaint Filed Against UW-Eau Claire Administrator,"Listen Live Carolyn Langton (CC-BY-SA) A gender discrimination complaint has been filed against a vice chancellor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire alleging he created a hostile work environment. The complaint comes from the sixth woman to resign from the campus admissions office in just more than a year. On Feb. 3, Angie Swenson-Holzinger resigned from her job as UW-Eau Claire’s associate director of advising after working on campus for three years. That same day she forwarded a copy of an exit survey provided by human resources to the campus Title IX and affirmative action director. The letter detailed what Swenson-Holzinger called a hostile work environment that led to her resignation, and stated Vice Chancellor of Enrollment Services Albert Colom began disparaging her and other female leaders on campus beginning in June. The complaint states one of the first things Colom asked Swenson-Holzinger to do after she began working for him was rank the academic advisors that she supervised from best to worst. ""When I would explain this was an impossible task as they were all very different and excelled and struggled in different ways, he would become frustrated and imply or say explicitly that this was an indication that I was a weak leader,"" wrote Swenson-Holzinger. Swenson-Holzinger's complaint also alleged whenever she would push back against Colom he would cite steadfast support from UW-Eau Claire’s Chancellor James Schmidt. ""He also regularly referred to 'Jim' and how he would support him in any decision he wanted to make in reference to the Chancellor,"" she wrote in her exit survey. ""In particular, he would make comments about having 'Jim's support' when threatening in veiled ways the job security of me and the team I supervised."" In an interview with WPR, Swenson-Holzinger said she often heard Colom disparage female leaders in advising and elsewhere on campus, but she had never heard him make similar comment about male colleagues. Swenson-Holzinger said when she decided to resign she wasn't planning to file a complaint with the university, but after consulting with a faculty union representative and other women who had problems with Colom she decided to come forward. ""My only goal, and I said this in the complaint, is to protect those who are left,"" said Swenson-Holzinger. ""I don’t want there to be a seventh and an eight and a ninth person that has to resign because they can't work in this toxic environment."" When WPR reached out to Colom for comment, the request was referred to Michael Rindo, UW-Eau Claire's vice chancellor for Facilities and University Relations. ""Whenever a complaint comes forward, whether it's about faculty, staff, administrators or even student employees, we have in place human resources and other processes that we use to provide fairness, consistency and most importantly, due process for all involved,"" Rindo said. Rindo said Colom had not been placed on leave in relation to the gender discrimination complaint. ""I would say it’s extremely rare someone is put on leave,"" he said. ""These kinds of complaints are not uncommon. They are taken seriously, and then they are referred to appropriate entities to conduct inquiries and ensure that due process is followed."" Rindo said an investigation into the matter is underway and will be directed by UW System Shared Services, which offers human resources assistance to campuses around the state. Stay informed with WPR's email newsletter. Enter email address Though Swenson-Holzinger's resignation is the latest in the advising office, it is far from the first. In January 2019, five women resigned their positions over a two-day period citing similar hostility from Colom. In an interview with WPR, Heather Pearson, who worked as an associate director of admissions, said she and four others resigned because of the way Colom treated former admissions director Heather Kretz. Pearson said Colom began attacking Kretz almost immediately after he was hired in 2018. ""From the very beginning he questioned Heather’s preparedness to be an admissions director, her competency in her job, just so many different things where there wasn't a basis to have those concerns,"" said Pearson. Pearson said she and others began collecting stories from people who worked for Colom at other universities and gave them to Kretz, who eventually scheduled a meeting with UW-Eau Claire Chancellor Schmidt. But Pearson said the chancellor signaled support for Colom and Kretz told colleagues she was going to resign. ""So, we cleaned out her office and met as a senior staff, and we started to just understand that this wasn’t a situation that any of us wanted to remain in,"" said Pearson. Pearson recalls that in January 2019, Kretz resigned on a Friday. Pearson, along with three others resigned the following Monday. In response to the mass resignation Schmidt sent an email to campus faculty, staff and student leaders announcing Kretz and the others were leaving the campus and that he wished them well. Schmidt's email ended by praising Colom for reforms he was making in campus advisement efforts. ""In the relatively short-time Vice Chancellor Colom has been with us, the university has made significant progress toward creation and implementation of a comprehensive recruitment, enrollment, retention and student success strategy,"" Scmidt wrote in the email, which Pearson provided to WPR. ""I support this comprehensive approach to enrollment management and believe the university, especially our students, will benefit greatly from it."" Pearson and Swenson-Holzinger mentioned that even before Colom started his tenure at UW-Eau Claire they had received warnings about his management style. Pearson said that through a mutual acquaintance John Yancey, who had worked under Colom at the University of North Florida in 2014, they had heard reports of bullying behavior from the administrator. In an interview with WPR, Yancey said everything he's hearing about the situation at UW-Eau Claire is consistent with what he saw every day in Florida. ""He was someone who sought to have you bear allegiance to fidelity for him,"" said Yancey. ""You had to be his standard-bearer and it was an atmosphere that he created that you were either with him or against him. And if you were against him you knew that your time there was limited."" Yancey said he too tendered his resignation because of Colom's behavior but was convinced by the college president to stay and work in another department. ""In retrospect that was probably the worst decision that I made because now I was able and forced to watch these things happen still, they didn’t go away, but now I was in no position to have any impact on them at all,"" Yancey said.

The original lawsuit was filed in March, four months before the USWNT won the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. A trial is set for May 5, but Thursday's motion called for judge R. Gary Klausner to rule in their favour without the case going to trial, per Yahoo Sports' Caitlin Murray. U.S. Soccer also filed a motion on Thursday to have the case dismissed out of hand. Lawyer and sports writer Miki Turner shared the motion on Twitter: NEWS: Both the @ussoccer and @USWNT have filed motions for summary judgment in the equal pay lawsuit. The filings are major in that if the #USSF wins, the case would be dismissed. The #USWNT filing says damages are estimated at $66 million. #USWNT #USSF https://t.co/N6HcU3ZU5M In March, 28 players filed the discrimination lawsuit under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The Athletic's Meg Linehan relayed the full list of the players involved as well as the exact damages being sought from Thursday's motion: Two lists of players involved, list one is EPA class members (38 players), second one is Title VII class members (72 players). #USWNT https://t.co/DneT4J2hPa In a statement, U.S. Soccer said the USWNT are paid differently to their male counterparts ""because they specifically asked for and negotiated a completely different contract"" and rejected a ""similar pay-to-play agreement"" the male players have. It also said the USWNT's contract includes benefits USMNT players do not receive, including ""guaranteed annual salaries, medical and dental insurance, paid child-care assistance, paid pregnancy and parental leave, severance benefits, salary continuation during periods of injury, access to a retirement plan, multiple bonuses and more."" Linehan relayed the whole statement: Statement from USSF, who have also hit tonight's filing deadline asking for the case to be dismissed. #USWNT https://t.co/njAWfdx0ao She also provided a statement from the players' spokesperson, Molly Levinson, who said the pay-to-play structure offered to the USWNT was comprised of lower wages than the male players ""in every instance"": Statement from Molly Levinson, spokesperson for the #USWNT players, fresh from the inbox. https://t.co/u2cARyQN0i Per Murray, the players' filing alleges U.S. Soccer's decisions surrounding the men's and women's respective compensation was based on ""gender stereotyping."" During last year's World Cup, Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl noted that in the three years following the women's victory at the 2015 tournament, they generated more revenue for U.S. Soccer than their male counterparts: The secondary ticket market for #USA-#FRA is exploding. Women's World Cup TV audiences around the world are setting unexpected records. USWNT revenues exceeded USMNT's for 3 years. The message is clear for FIFA and national federations: Pay. The. Women. https://t.co/MrpQ6h1pWE Per Murray, male players can earn up to $17,625 per victory and $5,000 per appearance, whereas the maximum a contracted USWNT player can earn for a win is $8,500. Contracted USWNT players don't receive appearance bonuses, while non-contracted players can earn a maximum of $4,250 per game.

1398,https://bobbyschindler.com/2020/02/17/not-dead-yet-assisted-suicide-laws-are-form-of-discrimination/,Not Dead Yet: Assisted Suicide Laws Are Form of Discrimination,"Menu  (Union Leader) – For over two decades the independent people of New Hampshire have been solidly against assisted suicide. Since 1996, the New Hampshire legislature has studied or voted down this proposed law so many times it takes two hands to count them all. Assisted suicide laws are the most egregious form of discrimination against severely disabled and “terminally ill” people. How can we call suicide a public health crisis for most people while facilitating the suicides of older, ill and disabled people? Should we not be doing everything we can to support such persons in having the best possible health care and home care so they have quality of life for however long they have? With the experience of the laws in Oregon as a guide, the question of assisted suicide becomes, quite frankly, incompatible with New Hampshire values. Our state motto, “Live Free or Die,” means we reject government interference in our daily lives.

1446,https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-railways-sued-for-discrimination-against-women/,Israel Railways sued for discrimination against women,"In a case reminiscent of the battles over segregated buses of the early 2010s, the legal advocacy arm of the Reform Movement announced on Tuesday that it was suing Israel Railways after an employee allegedly demanded that a female passenger change seats because men were praying nearby. Together with the Israel Women’s Network, the Israel Religious Action Center launched its suit on behalf of Maya Melitz, who they said was asked by an Israel Railways employee to vacate her seat because men were praying in the same train car. “Maya didn’t understand why she needed to move and refused, emphasizing that the train is a public place and not an Orthodox synagogue,” the two organizations said in a statement. “The employee persisted and asked her again to move to a different rail car because ‘it was disruptive that she was present in the rail car during prayer’ but Maya refused.” Orthodox commuters on Israel Railways trains frequently hold Jewish prayer services, complete with a mini-Torah scroll. Claiming that Israel Railways ignored their inquiries regarding compensation, the two groups then sued for NIS 66,969 ($19,584), IWN and IRAC said, describing the employee’s request as a violation of the Prohibition Against Discrimination Act. “At first I was shocked by the request to move from my seat on the train,” Melitz said. “The shock turned into offense that my presence, just because I am a woman, disrupted others from praying and that the only solution was that I would move. Just a moment before, I was enjoying listening to the prayer itself while minding my own business, and then the railway employee tried to explain to me that my mere existence was harmful to someone else.” IWN and IRAC stated that because this was not the first such incident, Israel Railways must publish written guidelines informing employees that such behavior is illegal. “It is unacceptable that a railway employee demand that a woman move to a different rail car because the fact that she is a woman disrupts prayer in that rail car. It is hard to believe that in 2020 women still need to fight for the right to be present in the public domain,” said IRAC executive director Anat Hoffman. “It is absurd that we need to sue Israel Railways because their employees do not yet understand that the exclusion of women is against the law. For this reason, our lawsuit not only demands compensation for Maya Melitz, but also that Israel Railways train their employees about their obligation to conduct themselves in the same manner toward all passengers and to not discriminate against or exclude women.” Hoffman is also director of Women of the Wall, an activist organization that advocates for the right of women to pray at the Western Wall with Torah scroll and prayer shawls, a custom opposed by the ultra-Orthodox. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that enforced gender segregation on public buses was illegal, leading to several years of heated struggle by ultra-Orthodox extremists to preserve gender segregation on bus lines serving their communities. In the past the Egged bus company had operated controversial segregated buses known as “Mehadrin buses” on certain intracity routes that pass through ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. Public buses contain notices informing riders that any attempt to force other passengers to move from the seat of their choice is a criminal offense (with the exception of specified spots for the disabled). Speaking at a political rally last year, a prominent ultra-Orthodox rabbi compared Israel unfavorably to Nazi Germany over the Jewish state’s failure to recognize the importance of separating men and women in public. Speaking at at the launch of the United Torah Judaism election campaign last March in the well-known Lederman Synagogue in Bnei Brak, Rabbi Aviezer Filtz, a prominent figure in UTJ and head of the religious seminary Yeshivat Toshia in the southern village of Tifrah, delivered a fiery speech on the importance of separate-gender seating on public buses. “Start to organize, to ride separately,” he urged his listeners, then explained that the principle was so fundamental that even the Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust obeyed this policy. “Even the Nazis, may their names be erased, understood that there has to be separate housing for women and men, but here [in Israel] it’s forbidden!” As The Times of Israel's environment reporter, I try to convey the facts and science behind climate change and environmental degradation, to explain - and critique - the official policies affecting our future, and to describe Israeli technologies that can form part of the solution.

1448,http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-to-pay-95k-to-settle-deaf-woman-s-discrimination-suit/568049172/,St. Paul to pay $95K to settle deaf woman's discrimination suit,"The city of St. Paul will pay $95,000 to settle a case brought by a deaf woman who said the St. Paul Police Department did not provide her with a qualified interpreter when she tried to file domestic assault charges. The City Council approved a settlement Wednesday with Catrina Hooper, who filed two lawsuits against the city alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Federal Rehabilitation Act and Minnesota Human Rights Act. In addition to the payout, the settlement requires the Police Department to provide interpreters certified in American Sign Language. The lawsuits also accuse the city of violating a 2013 settlement involving a deaf man who said he was mistreated after asking for written communication during a traffic stop. The man, Douglas Bahl, claimed that a scuffle ensued in which he was sprayed with a chemical irritant and pulled from his vehicle. According to a complaint filed in Ramsey County District Court, Hooper requested a qualified American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter for a September 2014 meeting at which she planned to file domestic assault charges against her mother. The Police Department offered an officer who was not a qualified interpreter, despite Hooper’s objections. When Hooper went to the police station to file her charge, officers arrested her in connection with the assault and did not provide a qualified interpreter to communicate during the arrest. After Hooper was released from jail, the complaint said, she tried again to file a domestic assault charge and give a statement. Police officers called her multiple times, inviting her to return to the department and make her complaint. When she did, officers arrested her again, and again did not provide an interpreter, the complaint said. “As a result of Defendant’s actions, its failure to act, and its policies and practices, Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, emotional injuries, including but not limited to, humiliation, embarrassment, and anxiety,” the complaint said. Court records show Hooper, 47, was convicted in 2015 of a misdemeanor assault that happened in September 2014. Hooper and her attorneys at the Minnesota Disability Law Center were not immediately available for comment. The city denies Hooper’s allegations, according to the settlement agreement. Police spokesman Steve Linders referred comment to the City Attorney’s Office. Under the Bahl settlement, the Police Department agreed to provide qualified ASL interpreters and train its staff on the communication needs of people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Under the Hooper settlement, Police Department policy will be amended to explicitly state that the department will use only certified ASL interpreters in scheduled interviews and meetings. Supervisors will be trained on the updated policy, as will all new employees for the next four years. “While this settlement was reached to avoid protracted litigation,” City Attorney Lyndsey Olson said in a statement Thursday, “it also provides an opportunity to expand city policy to ensure we’re better responding to the needs of everyone in our community.”  Emma Nelson is a Star Tribune metro team leader with an emphasis on St. Paul coverage. © 2021 StarTribune.

1473,https://nationalpost.com/news/minister-push-back-against-coronavirus-stigma-in-torontos-chinatown,‘Still a lot of discrimination out there’: Ministers urge against spreading coronavirus stigma in Toronto’s Chinatown,"The virus has killed 1,016 people among 42,638 confirmed cases in mainland China, and infected more than 43,000 people globally. In Canada, there have been seven confirmed cases of the illness TORONTO — The federal health minister and her Ontario counterpart are urging people not to give in to misinformation and stigma surrounding the novel coronavirus, adding that Canada continues to do its part to combat the global health emergency by containing cases of the illness to this country. Patty Hajdu and Christine Elliott met Tuesday in Toronto’s Chinatown, along with Mayor John Tory, to address the discrimination and loss of business they say some in the Chinese-Canadian community have felt. The two health ministers also toured Sunnybrook Hospital, which treated Canada’s first patient with the virus, and Hajdu praised the response from health-care providers, who she says have learned valuable lessons from the SARS outbreak in 2003. “The collaboration that we have at the local, provincial and federal levels is really paying off in our ability to work together and ensure people are supported so that we can do our global part to prevent the spread of disease around the world,” she said. The virus has killed 1,016 people among 42,638 confirmed cases in mainland China, and infected more than 43,000 people globally. In Canada, there have been seven confirmed cases of the illness. Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s provincial health officer said the four people diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in the province are doing well in isolation and would be cleared of the illness after two negative tests, 24 hours apart. The individuals in the Vancouver region are being monitored by health professionals and three of them are living in a home with others, she added. The federal government has agreed to provide $2 million to the World Health Organization to help vulnerable countries prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak beyond China. Hajdu said in addition to that effort, Canada must continue to be vigilant when it comes to monitoring for cases of the illness as part of the effort to contain its spread. “This is our global contribution to reducing the risk of a pandemic,” she said. “If Canada can take care of its own country in terms of reducing our rate of infection, in fact, we’re supporting the entire global population’s health.” Elliott said the province’s health-care system is working and the risk from the virus remains low. She stressed that the virus is an international situation and is not related to any one group of people. “There’s still a lot of discrimination out there,” she said. “We want to make sure that people know it’s safe to go out. It’s safe to come to your favourite restaurants … it’s safe to go shopping.” Tory praised the collaborative work of all three levels of government during the response, and asked people across the province to support people in the Chinese-Canadian community who have been impacted by some of the stigma and misinformation surrounding the virus. “What we must not do is allow ourselves in anyway to stigmatize or to stop patronizing the businesses of or otherwise treat differently any group of people,” he said. “I think, in particular, of our Chinese-Canadian population … which is so positive a contributor to the well-being of Toronto and to Canada.” The World Health Organization has named the new virus COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 because it was detected toward the end of last year.

The CROWN Act is a nationwide movement to stop employers from telling employees their natural hair isn’t appropriate for the workplace.

1534,https://www.edgemedianetwork.com/news/national//288187,Anti-Gay Michigan Wedding Venue Sues to Derail Discrimination Inquiry,"by Kilian Melloy EDGE Staff Reporter Friday February 14, 2020 A wedding venue in Michigan came under investigation by the state's Department of Civil Rights for turning away a same-sex couple on the basis of the owner's religious convictions. Now that venue is suing to stop the investigation, claiming that state law does not cover discrimination targeting LGBTQ people. Reports MLive: And the law's plain language does not. But the Michigan Department of Civil Rights is operating under an interpretation of the word ""sex"" - which the law does protect - to include sexual orientation and gender identity. ""Our defense is pretty simple,"" said David Kallman, an attorney representing the brothers, Jayme Rouch and Ben Rouch, who own the venue, which is called Rouch World. The state's anti-discrimination law, noted Kallman, ""does not include sexual orientation or gender identity as protected categories,"" ""We obviously hold a different legal opinion than the individuals who filed suit,"" said Vicki Levengood, a spokesperson for Michigan Department of Civil Rights. ""The Michigan Attorney General's office will defend our position in court and we continue to believe the courts will decide in our favor,"" Levengood added. The investigation was prompted by Rouch World's refusal to host the wedding of two brides, Natalie Johnson and Megan Oswalt, according to the suit, the news article said, before going on to add that the state legislature has addressed the issue of adding language to the law that specifically extends protections to LGBTQ people on at least eleven occasions, but attempts to broaden the law's protections have come to nothing so far. The issue of wedding venues refusing to host same-sex couples has been a recurring one, despite the 2015 Supreme Court finding that American same-sex families have the same right to enter into matrimony - and access the hundreds of rights and protections that comes with marriage - as do their mixed-gender peers. Americans are not the only ones who face such discrimination. The problem recently acquired an international character when YouTube and television personality, travel blogger, and ""Mr. Gay Canada"" Josh Rimer took to the Internet last December to share what he said was a ""homophobic"" experience inflicted on him and his fiancé by a Sheraton hotel in Puerto Vallarta. The hotel, Rimer told his audience, refused to host his wedding because it involved two grooms. ""This one really takes the cake,"" Rimer declared on camera. By that, he presumably meant the wedding cake. Another major hotel chain subsequently stepped in to host Rimer's wedding. As efforts grow to stymie new anti-discrimination laws and carve out exceptions to existing laws based on religion, LGBTQ people are not the only ones who have found themselves targeted. Last fall, the owner of a wedding venue cited the Bible in turning away a heterosexual couple because the groom was African American, whereas the bride was white. The story is very possibly predictive as to what could happen if the federal government under Donald Trump and Mike Pence succeeds in supplanting decades of progress with ""religious freedom"" laws that are designed to provide special rights to those operating out of religious bias - or any bias, for that matter, that can be justified as arising from ""deeply held"" beliefs. The venue owner in the latter case had initially defended her position by citing the Bible but, when challenged, was unable to find any passage in biblical scripture that supported her contention. She later issued an apology, saying, ""If I have learned anything from this it would be to know what you're talking about before you open your mouth!"" Such nuances may not be likely to occur to wedding venue operators who accept the narrative that the Bible condemns same-sex couples as ""abominations,"" a mistranslation of a term found in The Book of Leviticus. The original word actually meant ""taboo,"" and applied to ancient Israelites - but not to others. On the basis of such linguistic, cultural, and interpretive vagaries, some scholars dispute that the Bible actually does condemn LGBTQ people in the broad and absolutist manner that some Christians seem to believe it does.

1636,https://popculture.com/country-music/2020/02/04/luke-bryan-big-believer-female-artists-country-music-faced-discrimination/,Luke Bryan Is a 'Big Believer' Female Artists in Country Music Have Faced Discrimination,"By Gayle Thompson - February 5, 2020 09:28 am EST He may not have been aware of the disparity at first, but now Luke Bryan is a big believer in the fact that female artists have faced discrimination in country music, based on their gender. Bryan, who is taking out both Runaway June and Caylee Hammack on his upcoming Proud to Be Here Tour, vows to do everything he can to shed light on the challenging issue. ""I sometimes think that in life you don't realize there's an imbalance until you start looking at the stats, and the truth,"" Bryan told CMT's Cody Alan. ""I'm a big believer. The fact that we are now going to have two awesome female acts out there. It's very fun!"" The Georgia native is hopeful that the tide is finally changing, and women will once again have the same opportunities as their male counterparts. ""At the end of the day, the pressure is always on whether you're male or female to try and put out music that really connects with country music as a whole,"" Bryan said. ""You can see change is happening!"" Bryan is back at radio with ""What She Wants Tonight,"" from his upcoming Born Here, Live Here, Die Here, out on April 24. ""When I walked out of the studio, I literally had a headache,"" Bryan told Billboard, when discussing writing the new song. ""I had to take an Advil 'cause I felt like I was getting a migraine."" The song seems especially appropriate for Bryan to release now, especially because the song places control firmly with the woman. ""Back 20-30 years ago, that was a little more taboo for the woman to be controlling the narrative,"" Bryan conceded. ""But I feel like society has opened up a lot more. I think it's more natural for a woman to go, 'Hey, I like you. I'm focused in on you, and let's see where the night takes us.'"" Born Here, Live Here, Die Here will be Bryan's seventh studio album, although he hints it might be slightly different than his previous six records. ""I don't know if like a 15, 16 — for awhile that was the trend,"" Bryan told Taste of Country. ""The only thing that worries me — even with What Makes You Country, my latest album — there are songs on there that are just wonderful songs that do get a little ... lost in the mix. I think if we shrink the size of the albums and really focus on album size, you may in turn kind of make it that way.""

1808,https://www.news5cleveland.com/lifestyle/ohio-bill-introduced-to-ban-discrimination-against-natural-hairstyles-in-schools,Ohio bill introduced to ban discrimination against natural hairstyles in schools,"Menu COLUMBUS, Ohio — A bill that seeks to ban discrimination against natural hairstyles in Ohio schools was introduced Tuesday by two state representatives. Known as the ""Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) Act, the bill ""would ban discriminatory policies in Ohio schools that penalize students, especially students of color, for wearing natural hairstyles that embrace their cultural identities,"" according to a news release from State Representatives Juanita Brent (D-Cleveland) and Paula Hicks-Hudson (D-Toledo). Recently the CROWN laws, which have been passed in California, New York and New Jersey, prohibit hair discrimination at work, in schools and other public places. There are 22 other states and several cities considering similar legislation. “We want our schools to be welcoming places that embrace diversity—not discriminate against it. And yet, we continue to hear of instances of discrimination against black and brown kids who wear their hair naturally. The CROWN Act would end that,” Brent said. “This commonsense bill protects our kids and ensures they have the same opportunity to fulfill their promise as any other child in our state.” RELATED: Akron council to ask state to protect workers and students against discrimination by hairstyle The bill would prohibit discrimination against any person who wears a ""natural hairstyle or protective article that embraces their cultural identity,"" the release states. According to the news release, anyone who is discriminated against under the CROWN Act would be able to file a civil suit in ""any court of competent jurisdiction."" “The CROWN Act is a good first step to help eliminate the unconscious biases that too often hold people of color back in Ohio,” said Hicks-Hudson. “We work for you—and that means taking on discrimination whenever it happens, especially in our schools. At the end of the day, the way you wear your hair should not limit your pursuit of the American Dream.” RELATED: Local author and cosmetologist aims to break misconceptions about hair and race at workshop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1898,https://www.fox47news.com/news/local-news/100-000-people-sign-petition-to-prohibit-lgbtq-discrimination-in-michigan,"100,000 People Sign Petition to Prohibit LGBTQ Discrimination in Michigan","Menu LANSING, Mich. — Fair and Equal Michigan confirmed it has now collected its 100,000th signature on the road the 340,047 required to introduce a citizens’ bill in the State Legislature that would amend the state Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination. The committee is supported by business leaders, LGBTQ groups, and leaders from both sides of the political aisle. “This grassroots effort of Michigan citizens is now 100,000 people strong as we encourage the Legislature to prohibit discrimination of LGBTQ people. In just five weeks, we’ve scaled from zero to 628 fully trained volunteers along with a 145-person paid field team that led to our 100,000th signature collected. With broad support across the state our effort continues to be on time, on budget and at signature quality. After 37 years of attempts, it is time for the Legislature to give all Michiganders a fair and equal chance to succeed,” said Fair and Equal Michigan Co-Chair Trevor Thomas. Fair and Equal Michigan, launched on January 7 [fairandequalmichigan.com], seeks to introduce a citizens’ bill in the State Legislature after advocates collect 340,047 citizen signatures. The Legislature will then have 40 days to adopt the initiative as written or send it for voters to decide in the November election.Previously announced companies supporting Fair and Equal Michigan include DTE Energy, Consumers Energy, Apple, Dow, Rock Holdings, and Herman Miller. Last week, the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti Chamber endorsed the initiative [fairandequalmichigan.com]. Michigan’s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act already protects individuals against discrimination in employment, public accommodation and housing based on 10 factors, including age, race, sex, and religion. The Fair and Equal Michigan initiative would amend the current law by defining “sex” as including “gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression.” The campaign is planning a large signature collection push at polling places across the state for the March 10 Primary Election.

1909,https://www.newsy.com/stories/u-s-soccer-denies-gender-pay-discrimination/,U.S. Soccer Denies Gender Pay Discrimination (VIDEO),"The U.S. Soccer Federation denied discriminating against the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team in a filing on Monday. In the document, U.S. Soccer said that men's team players have ""more responsibility"" and that biological differences mean men have ""a higher level of skill based on speed and strength"" than women. It also says the two teams have ""materially different working conditions"" and that the men's team faces more hostility at matches than the women's team. This stems from a gender discrimination lawsuit that the USWNT filed last year. The women have demanded equal pay, arguing they bring in more revenue for U.S. Soccer and have won more titles than their male counterparts. The women's team has won three World Cup titles and four Olympic gold medals; the men's team has never won a World Cup or an Olympic gold. As Newsy has previously reported, the women's team was paid just under $2 million for winning the 2015 World Cup. In 2014, the men's team was paid more than $5 million after losing in the round of 16. USWNT spokesperson Molly Levinson responded to Monday's filing, saying U.S. Soccer's argument is ""just plain simple sexism and illustrates the very gender discrimination that caused us to file this lawsuit to begin with."" Levinson said the women's team looks forward to the trial, which is scheduled for May 5. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

1910,https://bylinetimes.com/2020/03/09/british-arms-sales-aiding-repression-in-chile/,British Arms Sales Aiding Repression in Chile – Byline Times,"In early February, mourners came together to remember the life of 37-year-old Jorge Mora – a man whose life ended on 28 January, hours after a police truck slammed into him outside a football stadium. The funeral in Chile’s capital city of Santiago was supposed to be a peaceful affair for Mora’s family and friends, as well as the many football supporters who came to pay their respects. But, when grief turned to anger and demonstrations broke out, the peace was shattered. Protestors and mourners were soon fleeing stinging tear gas fired off by riot police who showed little care for where and who they aimed at. Many escaped to safety, but one was not so lucky – a tear gas canister slammed into the the head of 24-year-old Ariel Moreno. The impact was so devastating that he was dead two days later. These events, that led to two more names being added to the list of the dead that has grown to more than 30 since protests began, represent just a snapshot of the violence that has torn through Chile since last October. Ordinary citizens have been rising up to take on the wealthy and the powerful who have helped create a society rife with inequality rooted in the 1973 overthrow of the democratically elected President Salvador Allende. The demonstrations began when the Chilean Government announced that it would increase the cost of public transport and, since then, thousands of people have been seriously inured by security forces using non-lethal weapons such as tear gas launchers and rubber bullets. Of the more than 5,000 injured, the United Nations said an “alarmingly high number” had injuries to their eyes or faces, indicating a “strong basis to believe that ‘less-lethal weapons’ have been used improperly and indiscriminately, against international principles on minimising the risk of injury”. A UN report adds that, while eye injuries were mainly the result of shotgun pellets, some cases were “due to the use of chemical irritants, in particular tear gas and, in some instances, from impacts from tear gas canisters”. In spite of this, Chile remains one the UK’s core markets for arms sales and the Government has continued to sell millions of pounds in arms and crowd-control equipment to the country. The Department for International Trade has said that the sales would not take place if there was evidence of internal repression, despite the UN stating three months ago that international human rights norms had been violated by both police and army personnel. The UN has also called for prosecutions. Meanwhile, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, has said that “the intention of the Chilean security forces is clear: to injure demonstrators in order to discourage protest”. Of the £164 million worth of arms licensed to Chile since 2008, 50% have been in the last 12 months. While not all have been related to equipment that would be used by security forces, an Open Individual Export Licence was issued on 12 June 2018, which allows a company to sell “smoke canisters”, “smoke/pyrotechnic ammunition”, “tear gas/riot control agents”, “training CS hand grenades” and “training tear gas/irritant ammunition”. Byline Times is funded by its subscribers. Receive our monthly print edition and help to support fearless, independent journalism. The Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) explained that an open licence means that the company – which Byline Times has been unable to verify – can export unlimited amounts of these items for a period of up to five years. It also does not need to report how much has been delivered. Other items exported in recent months include body armour, small arms ammunition and weapons sights. Byline Times asked the Department for International Trade whether any assessment has been undertaken to verify whether this equipment has been used in human rights abuses. A spokesman for the department said: “The Government takes its export responsibilities seriously and assesses all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria. We will not issue any export licences where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria, including where we assess there is a clear risk that they might be used for internal repression.” Grace Livingstone, a lecturer at Cambridge University and author of Britain and the Dictatorships of Argentina and Chile, 1973-82, said: “The UN has condemned the Chilean police and army personnel for widespread human rights abuses against protestors. It cites multiple cases of torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence against people held in detention. It says over 5,000 people have been injured and an ‘alarmingly high number’ of protestors have injuries to their eyes and face, suggesting that less-lethal weapons have been used ‘improperly and indiscriminately’. “Several protestors have been injured by shotgun pellets or tear-gas canisters. In this context, the United Kingdom should clearly not be selling arms to the Chilean police or armed forces. It should immediately stop approving the sales of weapons that could be used for internal repression. The UK ended exports of tear gas and smoke grenades to Hong Kong after evidence showed that they were being used against protestors in Hong Kong. Why has it not taken the same action on Chile? “Britain has a murky history of selling weapons to the dictatorship of General Pinochet in Chile, which was responsible for the ‘disappearance’ of thousands of people. It should not make the same mistake again.” Representatives from the Chilean Government were also invited to the ‘Security and Policing 2020 Arms Fair’ hosted by the UK Home Office in Farnborough. The event, which took place between 3 and 5 March, allows buyers to purchase technology for spying and surveillance – which the CAAT says can be used for “internal repression”. Others invited by the Department for International Trade’s Defence and Security Organisation – a civil service trade body that exists to promote arms exports – include Bahrain, Israel, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Uzbekistan, many of which have been accused of human rights abuses and torture. The sellers include BAE Systems, Leonardo and Thales, as well as surveillance companies such as the NSO Group, which makes spyware accused of having links to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the hacking of a phone belonging to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. In response to accusations about Mr Bezos, the company said it “can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance”. Andrew Smith of the CAAT said: “By promoting spyware and other repressive equipment to human rights abusing regimes and dictatorships, the UK is aiding and supporting their abuses. In many cases, the companies that are profiting from walls, fences and militarised borders are the same ones that are fuelling the wars that are causing displacement.” Carole Concha Bell, a member of the Chile Solidarity Network, told Byline Times: “As A Chilean, daughter of exiles from the Pinochet era, living in the UK it is disappointing to know that the UK has a license to export crowd control weapons to Chile, particularly when they are being used within the context of brutal, murderous repression, against a people sick of the hold that the Pinochet constitution still has on their lives. “It is shameful to continue supplying this equipment to a police force that only deals in violence, rape and torture. It doesn’t come as a huge shock when remembering that BAE gave Pinochet £1 million in 2005 – a heinous dictator held in the UK for 18 months, for extreme human rights atrocities. “[Foreign Secretary] Dominic Raab spoke of applying the Magnitsky Law at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2019, but this country has amnesia when it comes to putting profit over people. Chile Solidarity Network will be working hard to raise awareness of the gross human rights violations taking place in Chile and we hope to take our message to the UK Government that it’s not okay to do business with repressive states.” Chilean students and residents delivered a letter to the UK Foreign Office earlier this year to urge the Government to end the exports. A spokesman for the department wrote back this week: “The UK Government confirms that we are monitoring the situation in Chile and that our embassy in Santiago has talked with representatives of the Chilean Government and expressed concerns about allegations of human rights abuses by members of the security forces. The UK Government notes that the Chilean Government invited the UN Human Rights Commissioner and Human Rights Watch to send investigatory teams and has since accepted the recommendations of both reports. Our ambassador was told by a senior Chilean official that the Government is taking a twin approach: ensuring justice for the victims of human rights abuses so far, and preventing more violations in future.” Byline Times is funded by its subscribers.

1912,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/322916-organ-transplant-discrim/,Bill banning organ transplant discrimination passes Senate,"The Senate unanimously approved on Wednesday a House bill ensuring people with disabilities can receive organ transplants without fear of discrimination. Jacksonville Republican Rep. Jason Fischer‘s bill (HB 1179) would prevent health care facilities, insurers and other entities from denying organ transplant services to people with developmental or intellectual disabilities solely on that basis. Last month, the House passed the measure unanimously. The Americans with Disabilities Act prevents the discrimination against people with disabilities, including for organ transplants. But Fischer said transplant facilitators don’t know the protections apply to the transplant process. And Sen. Aaron Bean, who led a similar bill in the Senate up to this point (SB 1556), told the chamber floor on Tuesday that many don’t know they have a recourse if they’re denied a transplant. “Florida will no longer tolerate discrimination when it comes to organ transplants,” Bean said. Fischer, on the House floor before that chamber passed the bill, had asserted that discrimination reporting is low because people don’t know they can file to see why a transplant was denied. The bill outlines a framework in state law for people to seek recourse. “I think it’s important for us to codify it in Florida law so that it’s clear and unambiguous to hospitals, health care insurers, transplant organizations, that if you have an intellectual or developmental disability that you cannot be discriminated against when it comes to receiving an organ transplant if you need it,” Fischer said last month. Fischer said he has family members who were affected by disability discrimination. Disability rights advocates, including The Arc of Florida, support the legislation. “For decades, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have been denied access to these life-sustaining treatments,” said Arc of Florida CEO Kirk Hall earlier this year. “This legislation will help address the rampant discriminatory and arbitrary medical decision-making practices that create these barriers.” A.G.

1929,https://redstate.com/jeffc/2020/12/03/justice-department-files-discrimination-lawsuit-against-facebook-n288995,Justice Department Files Discrimination Lawsuit Against Facebook ," The Department of Justice (DOJ) just filed a serious legal action against social media company Facebook for allegedly discriminating against U.S. workers in its hiring practices. It is the latest in a series of legal actions that the Trump administration is taking against the organization. According to a DOJ press release, “the lawsuit alleges that Facebook refused to recruit, consider, or hire qualified and available U.S. workers for over 2,600 positions that Facebook, instead, reserved for temporary visa holders it sponsored for permanent work authorization (or ‘green cards’) in connection with the permanent labor certification process (PERM).” The lawsuit, which is based on a two-year investigation into the company, alleges that “Facebook intentionally created a hiring system in which it denied qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to learn about and apply for jobs that Facebook instead sought to channel to temporary visa holders Facebook wanted to sponsor for green cards.” Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband explained the charges against the company. “The Department of Justice’s lawsuit alleges that Facebook engaged in intentional and widespread violations of the law, by setting aside positions for temporary visa holders instead of considering interested and qualified U.S. workers,” he continued: “This lawsuit follows a nearly two-year investigation into Facebook’s practices and a ‘reasonable cause’ determination by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Our message to workers is clear: if companies deny employment opportunities by illegally preferring temporary visa holders, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable. Our message to all employers — including those in the technology sector — is clear: you cannot illegally prefer to recruit, consider, or hire temporary visa holders over U.S. workers.” The DOJ’s statement outlined the steps Facebook allegedly took to avoid hiring U.S. citizens. “Rather than conducting a genuine search for qualified and available U.S. workers for permanent positions sought by these temporary visa holders, Facebook reserved the positions for temporary visa holders because of their immigration status, according to the complaint.” The lawsuit also alleges that “Facebook sought to channel jobs to temporary visa holders at the expense of U.S. workers by failing to advertise those vacancies on its careers website, requiring applicants to apply by physical mail only, and refusing to consider any U.S. workers who applied for those positions. In contrast, Facebook’s usual hiring process relies on recruitment methods designed to encourage applications by advertising positions on its careers website, accepting electronic applications, and not pre-selecting candidates to be hired based on a candidate’s immigration status, according to the lawsuit.” If these allegations are true, Facebook might be in some hot water in more ways than one. While much of the focus has been on its censorship and privacy practices, it appears the company may have been breaking laws related to immigration. This suit, if it is allowed to go forward, could be yet another black eye on the company.  Let me know what you think in the comments below!

In his statement from the Carter Center, he says he is pained by racial injustice and the backlash it causes across America. He says his heart is with people who feel hopeless about discrimination in America, but that violence is never a solution. He acknowledges that he’s seen the impact of segregation as a white male growing up in the South and references part of his 1971 inaugural address where he says, “The time for racial discrimination is over.” He says it’s unfortunate that those words still ring true nearly five decades later. Since leaving the White House, Carter says he and Rosalyn have sought to advance human rights in other countries. He puts the onus on citizens to use their voices and stand up to discrimination. He concludes by stating, “We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this.” The full text of his statement is below: ""Rosalynn and I are pained by the tragic racial injustices and consequent backlash across our nation in recent weeks. Our hearts are with the victims’ families and all who feel hopeless in the face of pervasive racial discrimination and outright cruelty. We all must shine a spotlight on the immorality of racial discrimination. But violence, whether spontaneous or consciously incited, is not a solution. As a white male of the South, I know all too well the impact of segregation and injustice to African Americans. As a politician, I felt a responsibility to bring equity to my state and our country. In my 1974 inaugural address as Georgia’s governor, I said: “The time for racial discrimination is over.” With great sorrow and disappointment, I repeat those words today, nearly five decades later. Dehumanizing people debases us all; humanity is beautifully and almost infinitely diverse. The bonds of our common humanity must overcome the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices. Since leaving the White House in 1981, Rosalynn and I have strived to advance human rights in countries around the world. In this quest, we have seen that silence can be as deadly as violence. People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say “no more” to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy. We are responsible for creating a world of peace and equality for ourselves and future generations. We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this.""

People question why they are wearing masks. Are they sick? Do they have the coronavirus? We met up with some Asian families in Maryland to talk about how they’ve been affected by the coronavirus and mask-prejudice toward their community. ""American people don’t wear masks,"" says Ife, a Chinese economics student at Johns Hopkins University, ""and they have different ideas about why people are wearing the masks."" He says that Asians don't just wear masks because their sick or have contracted the coronavirus. ""They want to protect themselves and protect others."" Ife’s parents live in China where they have a Level 3 designation for the virus. That means all nonessential travel is restricted. A few days ago they asked him if he wanted to come home because they believe he would be safer there. ""The government in China needs everybody to wear the masks before they go out,"" Ife told us. ""If they do not have the masks they can’t go out."" He believes that’s why Asian countries are seeing improvement in the number of new cases. RELATED: Coronavirus focus moves west while new China cases diminish This chart from the CDC shows the new cases are decreasing in Asia while they are increasing in the United States. But Ife says the travel ban makes him hesitant to go back. ""I personally worry so much ... but I still want to stay here because I still need to finish my school, my degree,"" said the Johns Hopkins economic student. But wearing the mask every day as his parents would prefer is not an easy decision for him. ""Although I have the medical mask I don’t want to wear it, he said."" ""So that’s really a tough decision."" Namino Iwamoto is from Japan and lives in Bethesda with her husband and 17-month-old son. She says her biggest issue is getting the information she needs to stay safe. RELATED: Coronavirus: Here are the symptoms ""Because the TV is too fast for me to listen, so I get the information by Twitter, the new mom explained. Iwamoto's parents and mother-in-law are still in Japan. They have been texting her instructions in Japanese for how to stay safe. ""She says that washing hands is good to prevent infection,"" Iwamoto translated a text sent from her mother-in-law. ""And that just walking in the street is not dangerous."" Thankfully, neither Ife nor Namino has experienced any direct discrimination, but they acknowledged that both of their families are worried about that for them.

2113,https://freedomhouse.org/report/china-media-bulletin/2020/china-media-bulletin-coronavirus-era-repression-propaganda,"China Media Bulletin: Coronavirus-era repression, propaganda, censorship, surveillance and more (March 2020)","In this issue: How suppressing dissent remains a top priority for Beijing even amid a public health crisis, the evolution since January of propaganda, censorship, and surveillance related to the coronavirus outbreak, and tighter state media regulation, artistic censorship, and Chinese diplomats on Twitter far beyond China’s borders. A Doctor’s Death This illustration, based on a now-iconic photo of Chinese doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang, circulated widely on Chinese social media following Li’s death in Wuhan on February 7, 2020. Li had been reprimanded by police in early January for “spreading rumors,” after trying to warn colleagues on WeChat of cases of the SARS-like disease eventually acknowledged as Covid-19. He passed away after contracting the illness himself. His death sparked a rare, unified, and widespread uproar of grief and anger on Chinese social media platforms. Alongside tributes to Li’s courage and sacrifice, the hashtag “WeWantFreeSpeech” garnered over two million views within five hours on Sina Weibo before being censored. Credit: Kuang Biao ​HEADLINES: Suppression of dissent remains a top priority, and the stakes are higher than ever. By Sarah Cook Over the past month, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has marshalled the country’s public security apparatus to track down and detain known activists and ordinary citizens who have shared information about the coronavirus outbreak, provided on-the-ground updates from the epicenter, or reflected upon the epidemic’s implications for China’s governance model. But parts of the regime have also gone on the offensive against its political enemies more broadly, raising new questions about where party leaders’ priorities lie during a public health crisis and how far they will go to maintain their hold on power. The disappearance of three Chinese citizen journalists who had been live-streaming updates from Wuhan has drawn international attention. The three men—businessman Fang Bin, lawyer Chen Qiushi, and former journalist Li Zehua—had separately recorded and disseminated video reports from inside the locked-down city, its hospitals, and its quarantine centers. Over the past month, all three have vanished into some form of custody, detained by police or possibly quarantined despite their reported good health. While these cases are widely known, in part due to the men’s international contacts and the potency of their videos, there are many more like them. Media reports, updates from human rights groups, and posts on local government websites from the past month indicate that similar measures are being taken by authorities far from Wuhan. In Shandong Province, prodemocracy activist Ren Ziyuan was sent to 15 days of administrative detention for criticizing the government’s management of the epidemic online. Tan Zuoren, an online activist and former political prisoner in Sichuan Province, received multiple visits by police and had his account on the WeChat social media platform frozen. In Nanjing, former professor Guo Quan was arrested for “inciting subversion of state power” after publishing articles online with information related to the outbreak. Chinese Human Rights Defenders has documented over 450 cases of ordinary netizens who were detained for supposedly spreading “rumors.” Local government websites in Shandong, Jiangxi, Jilin, and Tianjin reported that security forces had arrested adherents of the banned Falun Gong spiritual practice who were handing out leaflets or posting banners with information related to the health crisis. In Tibetan areas, people have reportedly been subject to administrative detention for reporting suspected cases on WeChat or simply offering prayers. Yet officials have carried on with activities meant to reinforce political controls over Tibetan monasteries and households—for example gathering people to pledge loyalty to the national flag and sending party cadres to travel among villages—even when such actions run counter to recommended health safeguards. Some intimidation efforts appear to be reaching beyond China’s borders, with journalists reporting cases of Chinese WeChat users in the United States, Canada, France, Australia, and elsewhere being threatened or having their social media accounts silenced when they try to relay international news to relatives inside China. From what is known about the above examples, the individuals detained or threatened were not maliciously spreading disinformation that would cause public panic, but rather were sharing information they perceived as helpful to fellow citizens in the midst of a sudden, disorienting, and dangerous crisis that has been exacerbated by state censorship. And they often did so despite an awareness of the reprisals they might personally face as a result. Even as resources are stretched thin responding to the public health crisis, the CCP continues to prioritize crushing perceived threats to its political legitimacy. This tendency is evident from a recent flurry of actions meant to punish long-standing targets over political offenses that have nothing to do with the coronavirus. On February 25, for example, a mainland court imposed a 10-year prison sentence on Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong–based publisher of scandalous books about CCP leaders who had been abducted in 2015 from Thailand. Chinese authorities also apparently coerced him into renouncing his Swedish citizenship, which would strip him of a host of legal protections and set a dangerous precedent for any foreigner detained in China, though Sweden has not recognized the supposed change in nationality. Another instance was the February 28 arrest in Hong Kong of media tycoon Jimmy Lai for participating in a protest more than six months ago and making insulting comments to a journalist in 2017. Given that Lai has been in Beijing’s crosshairs for many years, the timing of the legally dubious arrests seems linked to a crisis of political legitimacy created by the viral outbreak. Two other veteran democracy advocates were arrested the same day. At the very least, the authorities may be using the extraordinary circumstances of the epidemic to take aggressive steps that they might otherwise be reluctant to attempt. Back in China, the judicial system continue to push forward with the politicized prosecution of other activists—like Guangxi Province rights lawyer Qin Yongpei and anti-discrimination advocate Cheng Yuan. Police harassed Cheng’s wife on March 3 after she posted a video calling for the release of her husband and two of his colleagues. In late February, Yang Xubin was sentenced in Guangdong Province to nine months in prison for expressing support for Hong Kong protesters. In a more prominent case, rights lawyer Xu Zhiyong, who was detained in Guangdong Province on February 15, had been on the run from authorities since December, when he attended a dinner meeting of activists. But the nationwide effort to track him down may have been accelerated by his recent comments and updates on Twitter and blogging platforms, including a scathing letter calling for President Xi Jinping to step down over the government’s mishandling of the coronavirus. Interestingly, when police came to the home of the friend Xu was staying with, they reportedly claimed to be checking residents’ temperatures. The visit ended with Xu and his hosts being taken into detention on political grounds. On March 7, Xu's family learned that he had been charged with ""inciting subversion of state power,"" which has yielded harsh sentences for numerous rights activists in recent years. Even without any intentional escalation, the harms caused by the regime’s repressive practices are magnified by the epidemic. For instance, Li Wenzu, the wife of jailed rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, cannot take her son to visit his father in Shandong. She reports that police have denied them the option of communicating by video. Meanwhile, outbreaks of the virus have been recorded in several prisons in Hubei, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces, including facilities known to have housed religious and political prisoners. As numerous observers have noted, the possible spread of the pathogen through detention camps in Xinjiang could be catastrophic for hundreds of thousands of Uighurs. Moreover, like the people of Wuhan and elsewhere who have suffered from the outbreak, the victims of the CCP’s politicized repression during this time will feel its effects for many years to come, whether due to long prison sentences, lost livelihoods, or actual health problems linked to their mistreatment in custody. Ironically, the repressive actions will not be without cost for the CCP itself. The high degree of censorship and at times preposterous propaganda over the past month and a half have weakened public trust in the regime and incentivized people to jump the Great Firewall or otherwise circumvent censorship. Gui Minhai’s mistreatment has galvanized condemnation not only from Sweden but also from the European Union and the United States. And days after Jimmy Lai’s arrest, Hong Kong saw its first round of protests since the epidemic began, as public anger overrode people’s fears of contagion. Still, the Chinese authorities are likely to continue prioritizing political repression in the coming months. The coronavirus outbreak—arguably more than any other development in the past decade—has shaken the foundations of CCP legitimacy, threatening the post-Tiananmen social contract in which citizens accept the loss of political rights and civil liberties in exchange for a sense of safety and growing prosperity. This renders the message of people like Xu Zhiyong more appealing to a larger contingent of Chinese citizens, and therefore more dangerous to Xi Jinping.

This article as also published in The Diplomat on March 9, 2020. Chinese state media coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak has gone through several phases since the first cases of the SARS-like illness emerged in Wuhan in late December. Cracks in the narrative: Some state media coverage has seen pushback by citizens—including youth—who find certain propaganda distasteful. One state-run newspaper published a video of women healthcare workers having their heads shaved before returning to treat patients; intended to portray them as “beautiful warriors” against the epidemic, the video was widely derided as humiliating and sexist. Likewise, a video by the state broadcaster China Central Television Channel (CCTV) showing a nine-months-pregnant nurse treating patients at a hospital in Wuhan drew criticism for using the woman as a “propaganda tool.” The early days of the Covid-19 outbreak were marked by tight censorship, especially by local authorities in Wuhan. But, since January 19, public concern about the virus has produced a flurry of investigative reporting into the unfolding crisis. For a few weeks, censors seemed to permit relatively open discussion of the virus, including on “self-media” platforms like WeChat, while professional journalists took advantage of the government’s slow response to publish reports on the early days of the outbreak and life under the dramatic lockdown of numerous cities in China. The state-owned magazine Sanlian Life even published an article on the potential impact of the coronavirus on China's economy, although it was later ordered deleted. By early February, tighter censorship began to be enforced following a meeting of the Politburo on February 3 to discuss the epidemic. On February 5, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) issued a notice concerning media coverage of the virus. In the announcement, public WeChat accounts were accused of having “illegally carried out reporting activities,” while the CAC placed internet companies like Sina Weibo and Tencent under “special supervision.” Tightened censorship following a period of relative openness when a sudden crisis emerges is a pattern that has occurred before, including following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and after a fatal 2011 high-speed rail crash. Of particular concern to government censors has been coverage of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who along with seven of his colleagues had been disciplined by local authorities for trying to share information about the coronavirus as early as the end of December. An article in Beijing Youth Daily about Li falling ill after treating an infected patient was ordered deleted by government censors on January 28. Following the doctor's death on February 7, an outpouring of public mourning and anger led to the government issuing censorship instructions to all media ordering them not to “sensationalize” the topic. Meanwhile, shortly after the hashtag “WeWantFreeSpeech” began trending on the Sina Weibo microblogging platform after Li’s death, it was swiftly censored. Three additional dimensions of the escalation in state censorship are especially notable: Even before the outbreak, new internet censorship rules targeting “negative content,” “sensationalist headlines,” and “excessive celebrity gossip” were scheduled to come into effect March 1. How these new regulations will be used to further tighten control over the media landscape—including over information about the coronavirus—remains to be seen. New high-tech monitoring systems have emerged as the Chinese authorities and the country’s citizens have sought to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. These include widespread deployment of thermal scanners to identify those with a fever, opportunities for citizens to obtain a record of their recent travels from state-run mobile phone companies, and electronic door seals that alert authorities if people under quarantine leave their homes. Three larger trends are particularly notable, in part because of their long-term implications: The use of surveillance technologies in response to the virus has raised new concerns over citizen data privacy and protection, as well as the long-term uses of collected data. While local governments claim that personal data collected as part of the fight against Covid-19 will be destroyed after the epidemic ends, critics are skeptical. A March 1 report by the New York Times suggests that Alipay's “health code” QR-scanning feature shares the user's personal information and location with the police. Moreover, Chinese internet users have increasingly expressed fears that their personal information could be stolen or sold to third parties without their knowledge. Even as fears of a large coronavirus outbreak grow in Hong Kong—where 98 cases have been reported as of March 1, and where the government is taking measures to limit travel from China—Hong Kong authorities and Chinese state media continue their efforts to thwart and discredit journalists covering the embattled prodemocracy movement, and others involved. Here are several notable events since late January: Positive developments: Amidst continuing restrictions on press and political freedoms in Hong Kong, there have been some pieces of good news. On February 21, prosecutors withdrew rioting charges against two men who participated in protests last August 24, the first known cases of such charges being dropped. And on February 24, Hong Kong Free Press, an independent English-language digital news outlet, was shortlisted for the Index on Censorship’s Freedom of Expression Awards. Even as Chinese state media outlets have pushed forward the Chinese leadership’s propaganda narratives and agenda regarding the coronavirus, a wide array of Chinese-language news outlets inside and outside the country have provided courageous and valuable coverage of the outbreak and initial cover-up. Several commercialized and financial news publications in China—despite some degree of state ownership—have tried to outpace censors or have directly defied them. Outlets like Caixin and the Economic Observer have conducted investigations into the early days of the outbreak and official cover-up, published accounts from patients and medical workers on the front lines, and scrutinized official infection tallies. Activists have gone to great lengths to preserve such reports from inside China before they can be deleted. Among other initiatives, one repository on GitHub includes an impressive collection of thousands of articles from dozens of news sources. Meanwhile, journalists and outlets based in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or among the Chinese diaspora have tried to identify credible alternative sources of information about the actual scale of infections and deaths, including by interviewing workers at funeral parlors in Wuhan and publishing leaked data from provincial health offices. Publicly funded outlets like Radio Free Asia and Deutche Welle, as well as Chinese-language versions of international media like the New York Times and Financial Times, have offered additional quality coverage to Chinese-language speakers. Taken together, these efforts have provided Chinese news consumers who know where to look with a more comprehensive understanding of the outbreak, despite extensive official censorship. Alongside public outcries and videos from citizen journalists, they also appear to have yielded some adjustments to government actions—be it central authorities dispatching discipline inspectors to Wuhan to investigate the wrongful punishment of doctors who tried to issue early warnings, or changes to case reporting guidelines to provide a more accurate sense for the scale of infections.  ​ Join the Freedom House monthly newsletter 1850 M St. NW Floor 11 Washington, DC 20036",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2399,https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2020/03/01/racial-discrimination-claims-against-hobbs-police-draw-unexpected-rebuttal/,Racial discrimination claims against Hobbs Police draw unexpected rebuttal,"The NM Political Report (https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2020/03/01/racial-discrimination-claims-against-hobbs-police-draw-unexpected-rebuttal/) Photo Credit: eviloars cc Shannon Kennedy was “shocked” when she came across a document filed by the defense for the Hobbs Police Department while preparing for a sweeping civil rights trial focused on allegations of racist policing. The well-known Albuquerque lawyer and her partners had hired a police practices expert and a demographer to investigate claims by three former Hobbs Police Department officers, their clients, that department brass pushed them out for raising concerns about targeting black and Hispanic communities. The demographer produced a detailed, 15-page report that showed Hobbs PD made a majority of “pedestrian stops” in the city’s heavily black and Hispanic south end and that non-whites were far more likely to find themselves detained by officers in such stops. The demographer’s report, which relied on population mapping and data analysis, was dated July 30, 2019. A few months later, lawyers representing the city of Hobbs, which has a documented history of discriminatory policing, hired its own expert to produce a report on “the perceived issues in the case.” The resulting two-and-a-half-page document says simply the methodology used by the plaintiffs’ demographer — examining stop, detention and arrest rates in certain locations — is “an ineffective and flawed measure” of policing. The report does not address the demographer’s findings. The signature at the bottom of the defense report: Dr. James Ginger. New Mexico law enforcement watchers and news consumers will be familiar with Ginger — since 2014 he’s been the court-approved federal monitor overseeing a yearslong reform effort aimed at correcting a “culture of aggression” within the Albuquerque Police Department, which was identified in a lengthy U.S. Department of Justice investigation. “At first I was like, ‘Is this him?’ I had to make sure,” Kennedy, who has sued APD many times and knows Ginger’s work there intimately, told New Mexico In Depth. “I have such a hard time with people who make money fighting for one kind of change, but who don’t acknowledge systemic racism in criminal justice. They need to be called out. This is why we are where we are today.” Ginger’s company has been paid millions of dollars for its work by the city of Albuquerque. Reached by telephone this week, Ginger declined to answer questions about his Hobbs report, which was filed in November. An Albuquerque-based lawyer who is representing Hobbs also declined to comment, and his co-counsel, an out-of-state lawyer, did not return NMID’s calls. Ginger’s role in the case raises a host of questions for Kennedy, whose firm provided copies of all three expert reports for NMID to review. His is among a small handful of companies that, particularly under President Barack Obama, flourished by acquiring high-dollar contracts to oversee systemic change in police departments across the country after the DOJ issued scathing reports detailing patterns of unconstitutional policing. Ginger’s work at APD has been a lengthy, data-intensive slog. Its intent is to resolve decades-old problems with the way officers use force, including deadly force, how supervisors investigate those cases and a leadership culture that too often turned a blind eye when cops went too far. From Kennedy’s perspective, Ginger’s job as change agent at APD doesn’t square with his report on the Hobbs case, which she said amounts to upholding the status quo of a different, unjust system in another part of the state. She sees Ginger’s document, which does not rely on his own data analysis, as a blanket defense of a highly controversial law enforcement tactic: hot-spot policing. “I am shocked, shocked to see that Dr. Ginger, someone who has been working with the DOJ to reform police departments around the country in the modern era would also work for insurance companies to purport that hot-spot policing is valid,” Kennedy said. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller’s administration, which pays Ginger for his work at APD, declined to make someone available for an interview about whether Ginger’s work in Hobbs affects the credibility of his oversight work with APD. The former Hobbs officers — Brandon Ellis and Vasshawn Robinson, who are black, and Jeremy Artis, who is white — claim in their 2017 lawsuit that a host of Hobbs officials, including Police Chief Christopher McCall and City Manager JJ Murphy violated the New Mexico Whistleblower Protection Act and the First and Fourteenth amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The trio said higher-ups retaliated against them for resisting orders to over-police heavily non-white sections of town and for meeting with local NAACP officials about their concerns. The officers claim they were essentially pushed out of Hobbs PD and that department brass tried to prevent them from getting law enforcement jobs elsewhere. Through contracted private lawyers, including a legal team from Ohio, the Hobbs officials have denied the claims in court filings. The case is headed toward trial in U.S. District Court amid renewed national focus and criticism of police tactics that are nearly identical to those alleged in the former officers’ lawsuit: “stop and frisk” and the overarching strategy it emerges from, known as “hot-spot policing.” Under that law enforcement philosophy, police brass identify “hot spots” in their city where they believe crime is concentrated, then “flood the zone” with a high volume of patrol officers. Those officers are instructed to stop pedestrians and motorists who fit generic descriptions of would-be criminals and search them for illegal contraband, known as “frisking.” Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg thrust the strategy into the national consciousness while he was running the city in the early 2000s. And he credited it for reducing crime in the Big Apple. But now he’s running for president, and black voters have excoriated Bloomberg for what they say was racist law enforcement practice — most of those stopped and frisked were not white — and the billionaire’s tepid apology for it. Some of Bloomberg’s Democratic rivals have hit him during debates and interviews for the use of stop and frisk, too. Kennedy said Hobbs has been using its own version of the controversial tactic for years. “They create the hotspot through discriminatory policing, then turn around and call it a hotspot,” she said, adding that it’s the department’s choice to send large patrols into predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods. It’s an old phenomenon in Hobbs. In the early 2000s, the police department was placed under the supervision of a federal judge and two appointed monitors after a class action lawsuit revealed racially discriminatory policing. One of the monitors, Robert Stewart, is now working as an expert for the plaintiffs in the new case. In his report, Stewart points out that five of the eight defendants named in the current lawsuit, including Chief McCall, were in the Hobbs department during the older case. Stewart concluded that “the manner in which some (Hobbs PD officers) unjustly targeted minorities in the south and east Patrol Areas by making highly discretionary stops and contacts was in an effort to satisfy their superiors’ pressure for them to aggressively make stops and arrests.” The report from the plaintiffs’ demographer, William Cooper, offers an in-depth analysis that brings the claims of Ellis, Robinson and Artis into sharper relief. Cooper used Hobbs PD’s own data to examine pedestrian stops between October 2016 and October 2018. He employed GIS software to map out the stops by street intersection and overlaid his analysis on top of a 2010 Census block map depicting race and ethnicity. (His report acknowledges that there has been a population increase in Hobbs since the last Census was taken.) Among Cooper’s findings: “The bullseye is on minority neighborhoods,” Cooper concluded. Not so, according to Ginger, whose report indicates he reviewed the documents filed by Cooper and Stewart and a submission by Kennedy laying out the cause for the court case. Ginger stated police officials don’t generally base their deployment decisions on geography or demographics. In his experience, calls to the police for help drive those choices. Cooper did not analyze Hobbs’ calls for police service, according to his report. “In my experience, the data yielded by Mr. Bill Cooper’s analysis, are evidence of effective police deployment practices,” Ginger wrote, adding that in his experience with departments around the country, police are more often called to “inner-city areas” and police brass often send high numbers of officers to those areas. He continued, saying he saw “no evidence” to support the former officers’ claims and offered a historical defense of Hobbs PD’s strategy as one based on data and evidence used to solve problems. “This was true in the ’70s when I ran highly focused anti-crime programs for my police department, it was true in the ’80s when I designed such allocation practices for the San Antonio Police Department, and it is true today,” Ginger wrote. Kennedy responded to that assertion with exasperation. “Time is a flat circle — there has been no progress to stop discriminatory policing since the ‘70s,” she said. “Who did it work for?” Kennedy questioned Ginger’s “side job” as an expert for a New Mexico police department that’s being sued for alleged racist practices — particularly given his court-approved push for deep change in Albuquerque. Although federal investigators did not find evidence of racial discrimination in their use-of-force probe at APD, they did uncover deeply rooted, systemic problems with leadership, supervision and culture. “I don’t think he should be the monitor,” Kennedy said of Ginger’s role in Albuquerque. “I think he should be disqualified as a result of writing this report. It’s contrary to bringing justice to communities that have borne the consequences of racist policing.” Asked to respond, Ginger said: “I will not respond to that; I’m not that stupid.” After laughing for a few seconds, Ginger continued: “She needs to argue her case in court, not in the news media. So, I won’t have a comment.” NMID sought an interview with Keller or someone in his administration about what Kennedy called the “cognitive dissonance” of Ginger defending hot-spot policing and apparently ignoring the stark figures unearthed by Kennedy’s demographer. Through a spokeswoman, Keller refused to be interviewed. Instead, the spokeswoman sent a statement that did not respond to NMID’s inquiries. “The monitor was selected by the previous administration and is overseen by the courts,” the spokeswoman wrote. “Only the court has the authority to make changes to the (DOJ/APD agreement.) We are committed to constitutional, community policing regardless of who oversees it.” Ginger, who refused to speak to NMID about his report, referred NMID to Luis Robles, of the Albuquerque-based firm Robles, Rael and Anaya. Robles is a frequently hired defense lawyer for New Mexico police departments when they are sued for alleged civil rights violations. Reached by telephone this week, Robles said his role was “very limited” in the case. Asked whether Ginger became involved in the Hobbs case through Robles, he declined to answer. Robles referred questions about Ginger’s report to attorney Todd Raskin of Cleveland, Ohio, who is lead counsel for Hobbs. Raskin did not return NMID’s calls. But Robles revealed a longtime professional relationship with Ginger that appears not to have previously been disclosed publicly: “I actually hired him as an expert to review the Internal Affairs process of the city of Albuquerque’s IA function back in the ‘90s.” It is not clear whether city or federal officials were or are aware of Ginger’s previous familiarity with areas at APD in which he is now overseeing wholesale change. Robles pointed out that Ginger does expert witness work in addition to serving as a monitor on Justice Department-led reform efforts. “I suppose you would think that’s the only thing he does, but he’s been doing this stuff for a really long time,” he said. According to records reviewed by NMID, Cooper and Stewart, the plaintiffs’ experts, were paid $125 and $191 an hour, respectively, for their reports. Ginger was paid $450 an hour to produce his.

2433,https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/03/is-medicine-a-minefield-of-gender-discrimination-and-abuse.html,Is medicine a minefield of gender discrimination and abuse?,"I am a 57-year-old female physician, and I remember an incident that involved a cardiologist on the other end of the phone, roughly fifteen years ago. I had recently started work as a hospitalist, and the cardiologist and I had never met. He clearly didn’t pay attention to my introduction, because when he heard my female voice calling from one the hospital floors to tell him that the twenty-seven-year-old patient I had admitted overnight for chest pain now had tombstones on his EKG, he scoffed and demanded to know who the patient’s doctor was. Once I clarified that he was speaking to the doctor, he focused in, and though still skeptical that a twenty-seven-year-old was having an MI, he promptly came to see the patient, whisked him off to the cath lab and opened up his clogged LAD. I have no idea if his behavior toward nurses has changed, but this cardiologist never questioned me again. This happened because of my gender. But here’s the thing. I’m not using this as a springboard to cry, “Me, too!” Instead, I am using this as an introduction to say, “not me.” You see, this is the only story like this that I have, and though I remember it clearly, it did not damage me in any way. It’s just a story. My medical school class was forty-nine percent female, so there was nothing unusual about a woman showing up for a clinical rotation. I had a classmate, I’ll call her Jane, who seemed to constantly have complaints about unfair treatment from her preceptors, and she was sure that it was because she was female. In many instances, I, and pretty much every other female classmate I knew, had worked with the same preceptors and experienced no difficulties. I suspected that Jane went into situations with an expectation that she would be treated differently. She had a gender chip on her shoulder and seemed to beg for it to get knocked off. She interpreted the actions of others within the framework of her expectations and managed to self-fulfill her prophecies. Either that or she just wasn’t a good student. I have never seen my gender as an issue. I don’t know if clinical rotations are any different today, but back then, if you knew your stuff and showed interest, you’d get taken along for the ride. If you were a slacker or a complainer, you got left in the dust. It applied to all students, whether you were male, female, black, or white. I have approached my career, and my life, in the same way, with the assumption that these things are irrelevant. I treat my colleagues with respect and anticipate the same. This is not to say that I have never been treated disrespectfully. I went from hospitalist to the ER fourteen years ago, and there’s not an ER doctor alive who hasn’t been talked down to by some specialist or the other, regardless of how many X or Y chromosomes you have. Sometimes, before I introduce myself and start talking, patients mistake me for the nurse. I don’t care. Many patients, especially older ones who have had little contact with the medical system in recent years, have a preconceived notion that a doctor is an old white man. For years, I also heard from patients that I was “too young” or “too pretty” to be a doctor (and every now and then, bizarrely, I still do). I work with male physicians who hear the same comments about age and attractiveness. It takes all of two seconds to move past this and leave them with a new construct of what a doctor is. I don’t wish to be insensitive to those women who have experienced true discrimination or sexual misconduct in the workplace. Accounts are abundant on social media and in the press, and there is a growing impression that these problems are ubiquitous. My experience says they are not, and at the risk of sounding like a traitor to womankind, I assert that we are very much in control of our own outcomes. Learn your stuff, let people know that you learned it, obey the Golden Rule. You belong in the place where you are. You earned it, just like the person next to you. Working in medicine is not a minefield of gender discrimination and abuse. It is an awesome career. Women should not be afraid and should not enter the field anticipating problems. Create your own framework of expectations that do not rely on gender, race, or age. Then, live them. Danielle Reznicsek is an emergency physician who blogs at Stories from the ER.

2439,https://lbpost.com/news/jury-rejects-white-ups-employees-racial-discrimination-lawsuit,Jury rejects white UPS employee's racial discrimination lawsuit • Long Beach Post News,"Subscribe to the Long Beach Post's daily eALERT and get the best local news in the city delivered to your inbox. A white United Parcel Service employee from Long Beach was not wrongfully fired in 2017 to appease a Latino employee, a jury found Wednesday. A Los Angeles Superior Court jury deliberated for about a day before rejecting the claims of 47-year-old Mason McConn, a former UPS dispatcher, for wrongful termination, racial discrimination, retaliation and defamation. The jury initially appeared to have found that McConn was defamed by negative remarks made about his character in the workplace, prompting Judge Yolanda Orozco to send the panel back into the jury room to deliberate further and clarify their conclusions. However, shortly thereafter, the jury sent the judge a note saying they found that UPS management used reasonable care in trying to determine the truth or falsity of the statements. Jurors later interviewed by lawyers outside the courtroom repeated that explanation, adding that while some of the statements about McConn may have been false, the company acted properly in investigating whether they were accurate or not. The jurors also said that although they did not believe UPS did everything right, there was no evidence McConn was a victim of racial discrimination or retaliation. Trial testimony showed that the Latino employee who repeatedly clashed with McConn, UPS driver Pedro Flores, was supervised by McConn. A UPS truck. Photo by Ken Teegardin shared under a creative commons license. “Mr. Flores’ goal was always to get Mr. McConn fired,” plaintiff’s attorney J. Bernard Alexander said in his opening statement. According to Alexander, McConn worked for UPS for 12 years and his job was to supervise drivers at the Ontario facility who distributed freight throughout Los Angeles County. McConn was well liked by drivers and management, who commended him for his work, the attorney said. Although profanity was commonly used by those who worked on the UPS dock, the company used two incidents of McConn using foul language twice within 11 months as a pretext to fire him, Alexander said. A shortage of drivers prompted McConn to assign more work to those in the UPS work force, which angered Flores, according to Alexander. When the plaintiff assigned Flores work, Flores became insubordinate and asked why the tasks were not given to white drivers, according to Alexander. Flores called McConn a racist, alleged that McConn discriminated against him and said the plaintiff brushed against him during one incident, according to Alexander. Flores threatened to sue McConn and to take away his home in the process, Alexander said. UPS, citing the allegations that McConn used profanity in the workplace, ultimately fired him in 2017 because the company was more concerned about a threat of a lawsuit by Flores than facing the truth, Alexander said. Many of McConn’s former co-workers of many different races circulated a petition after his firing demanding he be reinstated, but the company refused to give him his job back, according to Alexander. Flores went on a leave from UPS in 2016 and never returned, Alexander said. UPS attorney William B. Hill said McConn did not lose his job because he is white, but instead, due to his “unprofessional conduct in managing employees.” The attorney cited two clashes McConn had with Flores and a third with another UPS employee, saying his conduct fell below the standards of what are expected of a manager in his position. Hill also said McConn admitted he may have brushed against Flores during one of the incidents between them. Hill said McConn was repeatedly counseled by a human resources manager for his interactions with the two workers, but to no avail. He also said UPS investigated complaints McConn made and took them seriously.

2549,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/congress-stages-walkout-of-himachal-pradesh-assembly-over-discrimination-against-dalits-in-state,Congress stages walkout of Himachal Pradesh Assembly over ‘discrimination’ against Dalits in state,"Follow Us The opposition Congress on Monday walked out of the Himachal Pradesh Assembly over alleged discrimination against Dalits in the state. Flaying the Congress, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said instead of walking out of the assembly, the opposition party should have had a serious discussion on how to eliminate such discrimination. He claimed that the Congress MLAs were doing this just to remain in headlines of the newspapers. The Congress legislators returned to the House within a few minutes of the walkout and then raised slogans against the BJP government in the state. According to a police complaint, Chandramani, resident of a village in Mandi's Balh tehsil, had organised a religious function at his home on Sunday when Narendra Kumar came there and disrupted the programme by pouring water into the 'chulah'. He also allegedly kicked the utensils containing food. An FIR was registered at Balh police station under relevant sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act based on the complaint. The chief minister said the matter was being investigated by Mandi DSP Anil Patial and the accused would be held after verifying the facts. Congress MLA Nand Lal said there has been several incidents of discrimination against Dalits in the recent time in the state. Alleging that a local BJP leader was involved in the recent episode, he said, ""This is the second such incident within a few days in the CM's home district."" To which, Chief Minister Thakur, replied, ""It is not right to connect such people with any party. We should condemn such incidents in one voice irrespective of whosoever is involved in these crimes."" Citing another such incident which happened a few days ago in the state, he said two people were arrested after Sushil lodged a police compliant that his co-villagers Dila Ram and Vijay Kumar refused to serve him food in a public feast (Samuhik Bhoj) during Shivratri festival and also threatened to eliminate him. ""I did not want to say this but as the opposition levelled allegations that a local BJP leader is involved in the recent incident, I want to make it clear that one of the two accused involved in the earlier case in Mandi is a Zila Parishad member, who is also an officer-bearer of the Congress,"" Thakur said.

2558,https://imemc.org/article/samidoun-germany-escalates-attack-on-khaled-barakat-palestinian-rights-with-four-year-ban-fight-back-against-repression/,"Samidoun: Germany escalates attack on Khaled Barakat, Palestinian rights with four-year ban: Fight back against repression!","International Middle East Media Center By Samidoun – Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network: The German state has once again escalated its harassment and repression directed against Palestinian speech and advocacy. In the latest order issued by the Berlin immigration office, received yesterday, 9 March, German officials escalated their attacks on Palestinian writer and activist Khaled Barakat, ordering him officially expelled from Germany (even though he has not been living in Germany since August 2019) and banning him from entering the country for four years. Barakat and his lawyer are challenging the order in an appeal. In addition to the political ban, residency denial and now exclusion imposed on Barakat, recent repressive attacks by the German state on Palestinian rights have included the deportation of Rasmea Odeh, the passing of an anti-BDS resolution in the Bundestag, the criminal prosecution of Palestinian and Israeli Jewish activists for interrupting a speech by a member of the Knesset, the forced resignation of the director of the Jewish Museum, the closing of the bank account of Jewish Voices for a Just Peace and the disinvitation of international artists who have taken a stand to support Palestinian rights. This continued targeting of Palestinian community organizing, Palestine solidarity and progressive activism comes even as the very real threat of far-right violence continues to threaten the lives of Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims and people of color throughout Germany, as reflected in the horrific racist attack in Hanau. Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network calls on all who stand for justice in Palestine to confront the repression that is taking place in Germany, in Europe and internationally. As Trump and Netanyahu attempt to impose their “deal of the century” and liquidate the Palestinian cause, these efforts to criminalize, silence and repress Palestinian and Palestine solidarity organizing are part and parcel of that comprehensive attack. At the same time, they also indicate the real fear of these forces – not of a “threat to security” from Palestinian organizing, but of the power of organized communities to make real change and struggle for the liberation of Palestine – and to fight for justice in their countries of exile as well. Here, they attempt to silence a progressive vision of a liberated, democratic Palestine. Watch the 17 August speech German officials are trying to silence here:  This is not an attack on Khaled Barakat alone, an attack on one person or even on one political trend in the Palestinian movement. Indeed, the order itself openly declares that it intends to deter all foreign nationals from advocating for the boycott of Israel! The only response to such a shameless attack on the rights of the Palestinian people, oppressed communities and all who stand for justice and liberation is to escalate our organizing and make clear that such attempts at silencing, repression and liquidation are unacceptable. We stand with Khaled Barakat – and we stand together, for the liberation of Palestine and against racism, Zionism and imperialism. The political nature of the order is overt and unconcealed throughout the 23-page document. It is based entirely on public political speeches, writings and YouTube videos and does not allege criminal activity; indeed, the order notes that criteria relating to criminal convictions do not apply in this case. This comes after a political ban of over one month was ordered against Barakat in June 2019 in order to prevent him from giving a speech on U.S. President Donald Trump’s so-called “Deal of the Century” and the attack on Palestinian rights, and then, the denial of the renewal of his residency visa. The nature of this attack is clear throughout the document. “The so-called two-state solution is dead. The Palestinian people have no choice but to continue their struggle until the liberation of all of Palestine and the construction of a democratic society in Palestine,” Barakat said in a meeting with the South African ambassador to Germany. This progressive vision of a liberated, democratic Palestine is cited twice in the document as evidence of an “extremist” perspective that is “unacceptable” in Germany. It further classifies opposition to the Oslo process, the so-called “peace process” that has been a lengthy process of attempted liquidation of Palestine, as another element of unacceptable “extremism,” alongside rejection of the “two-state solution.” (Of course, this criterion is not considered relevant when it is Zionists who want to colonize all of Palestine who reject Oslo or two states; it is only “extremism” for Palestinians and their supporters who want to liberate all of Palestine.) It emphasizes, “Your expulsion is intended to make it clear to other third-country nationals that such agitations against the State of Israel…in the Federal Republic of Germany…can also lead to consequences under residence law.” Perhaps most disturbing is the stated purpose of the denial of Khaled Barakat’s rights – not solely to attempt to silence him as an individual, but to terrorize the Palestinian and Arab community in Berlin and more broadly, throughout Germany and Europe. This order comes as part and parcel of an attempt to suppress the potential organizing of thousands of Palestinian and Arab youth in Berlin, in Germany and throughout Europe, and more broadly, the power of organized communities to fight racism, oppression and colonialism. As Barakat said, this order is actually aimed not only against him as a writer, journalist and political activist, but at “thousands of Palestinian youth in the cafes on the Arab street in central Berlin. These forces are afraid of the organized power of impoverished youth from the popular neighborhoods and European city centers, of the possibility that they will become fully aware of their potential strength and power and unite and organize to take up the project of return and liberation. All of Europe’s officialdom expresses its ‘fear’ of the refugee masses at its shores. Germany wants to suppress, police and silence the Palestinian, Arab, Kurdish, Turkish, Iranian, African communities and impose upon them the burden of the terrible massacres that the German state committed against peoples, especially the massacre of Jews. This report makes clear that repressive state security structures want to stop the coming renaissance of the Palestinian people in diaspora.” Mohammed Khatib, Europe coordinator of Samidoun, said: “Their real fear is the mobilization of tens of thousands of Palestinian youth, hundreds of thousands of young Arabs, millions of migrants, people of color, and all oppressed groups that together demand the liberation of Palestine and fight for rights, justice, freedom and equality.” Redfish report on the political ban:  The order repeatedly attacks movements and organizations struggling for Palestinian rights, including the BDS campaign, Hirak – a movement of Palestinian youth in Berlin – and Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, uncritically parroting claims of the Israeli “anti-BDS ministry,” the Ministry of Strategic Affairs, whose payments to the Jerusalem Post to run its anti-Palestinian propaganda campaigns sparked a scandal. It even attempts to use Barakat’s speech at the European Parliament of 10 July 2019 – about the political ban on him and the repression of Palestinian advocacy in Germany – against him, claiming that being invited to the European Parliament is somehow proof that he is a leader of the PFLP. It unquestioningly reiterates German right-wing media and Israeli propaganda claims against his speech while neglecting to report that the smear campaign was decisively repudiated by the European Parliament itself in August 2019: “Mr Barakat and Samidoun, the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, are not amongst the persons or groups and entities covered by these provisions. Further, Mr Barakat did not enter Parliament’s premises as a representative of the Popular Front For the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), nor did he speak on behalf of this group. The PFLP was not mentioned nor promoted during the event. “The primary purpose of the visit was to offer Mr Barakat the opportunity to address a meeting in Parliament on Palestine-related matters, and oppose the speaking ban imposed upon Mr Barakat by German authorities in June 2019.”  The document declares, “your expulsion is also considered necessary to deter other foreigners…your expulsion must also make other foreign nationals aware that the state does not tolerate anti-Semitic statements approving the use of force and boycotts against sovereign states.” This reflects the Israeli state’s global campaign against growing international support for the call for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) and the attempt to distort the meaning of anti-Semitism for an anti-Palestinian smear campaign. It must be emphasized that the definition of “anti-Semitism” used here is not one that refers to any form of hatred against Jewish people or Judaism as a faith; instead, the document has redefined anti-Semitism to mean, variously: “opposing the existence of the State of Israel,” “talking about the ‘racist project of Israel,’” “calling into question the right to exist of the Jewish and democratic state of Israel and its legitimate right of national defense,” and supporting the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement. Therefore, this order is clearly meant as a threat to other non-German and non-European citizens in Germany that they may face severe repression, up to and including deportation, for supporting the boycott of Israel, or for expressing that the Palestinian people have the right to resist occupation and oppression. This kind of attack on freedom of expression should shock the conscience of all who claim to uphold human rights, particularly civil and political rights. While it is not referenced by name in the document, it apparently draws inspiration from the so-called IHRA definition and examples that Israel lobby organizations have been attempting to have adopted in parliaments, councils and other institutions around the world. The IHRA’s “examples” include stating that “Israel is a racist endeavour” may be anti-Semitic, while here, “the racist project of Israel” is labeled anti-Semitic as well. All of this is shameless propaganda for an Israeli state in cahoots with the most extreme right-wing and fascist forces around the world, while people of color and Jews remain facing actual threats from neo-Nazis and far-right forces in Germany. Instead, the German state throws its repressive weight to attempt to silence a leftist Palestinian writer and activist. This attempt to redefine anti-Semitism and focus on Palestinians and Arabs also serves the purpose of whitewashing far right and fascist forces throughout Europe, both those serving in government positions and those engaging in street violence against Jews and people of color. Indeed, while labeling it anti-Semitic to “call into question….Israel’s legitimate right to national defense” -i.e., to perpetrate colonial warfare on indigenous people, the document repeatedly affirms that it is unacceptable to recognize Palestinians’ right to resist. Saying that Palestinians “have the right to exercise all forms of resistance, including armed revolutionary violence, until the Palestinian people have achieved all their national aspirations” is labeled “extremist.” At the same time, it is declared equally, or perhaps even more unacceptable in the same document to simply advocate for the peaceful boycott of Israeli goods and corporations. While the document repeatedly refers to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist Palestinian political party and resistance movement, in an attempt to justify repressing Barakat’s speeches and writing, let alone expelling him from the country – despite the fact that the PFLP is not illegal in Germany – it also states that, in the end, it does not matter whether or not he is a member of the PFLP, because he adheres to its political goals. Specifically, these political goals are defined as “overcoming the state of Israel and establishing the state of Palestine,” “negating Israel’s right to exist,” and “the liberation of Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea,” certainly the political goals of vast numbers of not only Palestinians and Arabs, but all who stand for justice in Palestine. The document repeatedly notes that Barakat refuses to “recognize Israel’s right to exist.” Of course, states do not have a “right to exist,” people do – and it is human rights, people’s rights, that are under attack by the Israeli state and its imperialist partners and allies around the world, including the German state. For Palestinians, this demand to recognize the “right to exist” of an occupying power on their land is a demand to accept the legitimacy of the Nakba and to approve of the expulsion of over 700,000 Palestinian refugees from their homes and lands and the continuing denial of the right of return of millions of Palestinians today. It is to demand indigenous people praise the “legitimacy” and “right” of their colonizer and occupier to steal their land, imprison their leaders, demolish their homes and confiscate their resources. Not only should this be unacceptable to Palestinians, the demand to recognize “Israel’s right to exist” is one of colonial domination that should be repellent to all who stand for justice and human dignity. It is notable that the order is repeatedly appalled by Barakat’s advocacy of an inclusive, democratic Palestine that embraces people of all religions, demanding instead support for an exclusivist colonial state built on the dispossession and subjugation of the Palestinian people and their land. It must further be noted that, when the German Bundestag passed its notorious anti-BDS resolution in May 2019, over the objection of Palestine justice advocates, Jewish supporters of justice and opponents of apartheid, and defenders of freedom of expression, it claimed that it was a “non-legally-binding resolution.” Nevertheless, that very text is used multiple times within this document to justify barring a Palestinian writer from returning to Germany for four years, making clear that it is being allowed to present a real, legal threat to Palestinians, Arabs and members of communities and political movements targeted by the German state for repression and silencing. The document reflects such hatred toward the growing BDS movement that it exceeds even typical Israeli state propaganda, claiming that “your public advocacy of the aims of BDS and support for a ‘comprehensive boycott call’ against Israeli goods and services constitutes an arbitrary measure” that allegedly violates the rights of “Israeli citizens and persons of Jewish faith in Berlin.” Of course, this makes no mention of the many Jewish people in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany, including Israeli citizens, who have faced various levels of state persecution and repression for their support for BDS and Palestinian rights. Jewish Voices for a Just Peace had its bank account shut down, while two Israeli activists and a Palestinian activist face criminal charges for interrupting a speech by a Knesset member in Berlin. This attempt to shamelessly instrumentalize Jews and equate Jewish people with Zionism and the state of Israel – a truly anti-Semitic framework, unlike support for the liberation of Palestine – comes hand in hand with the repression of actual Jewish people who stand for justice in Palestine. The document concludes by ordering that Barakat be excluded from the country for four years. Barakat and his lawyer are appealing immediately, of course, but the conclusion contains other disturbing assertions. Not only does it attempt to justify this four-year ban solely on the basis of political activity, articles and speeches, it further declares openly that there is a “risk of the behavior being repeated,” namely: “since the year 2014 at the latest, you have repeatedly expressed your views on the Palestinian question during your stay in the Federal Republic of Germany and, in doing so, you have returned to the Palestinian population’s alleged right to resist and welcomed this in your speeches. It is therefore to be expected that you will also do so in further statements in the Federal Republic,” as a justification for his expulsion. It argues that Barakat must show that he has changed his “internal attitude” in order to be exempt from the ban, including “admitting or at least no longer denying that his actions in the past cause a danger,” despite the fact that those actions are, in this case, giving speeches and writing articles about Palestine. In essence, there is a demand that not only Khaled Barakat, but all Palestinians, must depoliticize and silence themselves in order to be welcome or even to exist in Germany, a fundamentally racist and colonialist premise. There is much more to be said about this egregious order and how it fits into the overall framework of the attempt to silence Palestinian organizing and Palestine solidarity in Berlin. It must be noted that, despite these ongoing attacks, that organizing and activism continue to thrive and grow, with hundreds and thousands taking the streets and constant events and discussions about Palestine taking place on a daily and weekly basis. While such efforts may be destined to fail, it is all of our responsibility to fight back, to defend Palestinian rights everywhere in exile and diaspora, as well as throughout all of historic Palestine. This means building the boycott movement and the BDS campaign, defending Palestinians’ right to resist occupation and oppression and organizing together to confront Zionism, reaction and imperialism. We stand with Khaled Barakat! From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!

The renewal comes despite calls by African leaders, including South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, for the sanctions to be lifted to give the country a chance to recover from its economic crisis. According to Trump administration officials the sanctions will remain until the government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa changes Zimbabwe’s laws restricting media freedom and allowing protests.

2680,https://www.khasokhas.com/109033,US Report : Discrimination against lower castes was widespread in Nepal,"प्रकाशित मिति : फाल्गुन २९, २०७६ बिहीबार Nepal is a federal democratic republic. The 2015 constitution established the political system, including the framework for a prime minister as the chief executive, a bicameral parliament, and seven provinces. In 2017 the country held national elections for the lower house of parliament and the newly created provincial assemblies. Domestic and international observers characterized the national elections as “generally well conducted,” although some noted a lack of transparency in the work of the Election Commission of Nepal (ECN). The Nepal Police are responsible for enforcing law and order across the country. The Armed Police Force (APF) is responsible for combating terrorism, providing security during riots and public disturbances, assisting in natural disasters, and protecting vital infrastructure, public officials, and the borders. The Nepal Police and APF report to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Nepali Army (NA) is responsible for external security and international peacekeeping, but also has some domestic security responsibilities such as disaster relief operations and nature conservation efforts. The NA reports to the Ministry of Defense. Civilian authorities maintained effective authority over the Nepal Police, APF, and Army. Significant human rights issues included: reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings; torture; arbitrary detention by government; site blocking and criminal defamation laws; interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including overly restrictive NGO laws; restrictions on freedom of movement for refugees, notably resident Tibetans; significant acts of corruption; and use of forced, compulsory, and child labor. The government investigated but did not routinely hold accountable those officials and security forces accused of committing violations of the law. Security personnel accused of using excessive force in controlling protests in recent years did not face notable accountability nor did most conflict-era human rights violators. There were several reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. On June 20, police in Sarlahi killed a local leader of the Maoist splinter party Biplav. Police reported they shot Kumar Paudel after he fired at them. A preliminary investigation from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) suggested the death was suspicious and the human rights NGO Advocacy Forum-Nepal reported the encounter was likely staged. As of September, no police personnel had been charged. The August 2018 case of Nepal Police killing two men suspected in the kidnapping and death of an 11-year-old boy, Nishan Khadka, in Bhaktapur remained unresolved. Human rights activists and local media said the suspects were already in police custody and that the police staged the encounter to justify their killing. In August 2018 the APF opened fire in Kanchanpur on a crowd that had gathered to demand justice after a 13-year-old girl, Nirmala Panta, was raped and killed; the APF shooting resulted in the death of a 14-year-old boy and injury to 24 protestors. As of September, eight police officers were suspended and two terminated based on the Home Ministry’s probe committee recommendation into the APF shooting; in the underlying case of the rape and murder of Nirmala Panta, police had no suspect in custody. The NHRC investigated the September 2018 death of Ram Manohar Yadav of the Free Madhesh movement in police custody following his arrest a week earlier. Human rights activists claimed police tortured Yadav and failed to provide adequate medical attention after he fell ill. The Ministry of Home Affairs denied the claims but admitted Yadav was taken to four different hospitals in search of an intensive care unit. In July the Home Ministry reached an agreement to compensate the victim’s family NRs 1 million ($10,000) and the NHRC closed the case, but no police personnel were punished. The High-level Enquiry Commission (HLEC) formed to investigate allegations of excessive use of force by the Nepal Police and APF completed its investigation of more than 3,000 complaints received in 2017 related to protests over the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. The 2015 protests left 45 individuals dead, including nine police officers. The HLEC disbanded after it completed its report, but the government had not made the report public by year’s end.  The 2018 criminal code formally criminalizes enforced disappearance. There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities during the year. The fate of most of those who disappeared during the 1996-2006 civil conflict remained unknown. According to the NHRC, 801 cases of disappearances remain unresolved, most of which the NHRC says may have involved state actors. As of early December, the government did not prosecute any government officials, current or former, for involvement in conflict-era disappearances, nor had it released information on the whereabouts of the 606 persons the NHRC identified as having been disappeared by state actors. The NHRC reported that Maoists were believed to be involved in 149 unresolved disappearances during the conflict. As of early December, the government had not prosecuted any Maoists or state actors for involvement in disappearances. In 2017 the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) formed five teams to begin investigating complaints of disappearances filed by conflict-era victims. The commission had before it 3,197 registered cases and ultimately pursued 2,512 cases. In April the CIEDP reported 2,008 cases completed. Human rights organizations continued to express concern over flaws related to the CIEDP. According to the International Commission of Jurists, CIEDP investigations suffered from inadequate human and financial resources to handle the large number of cases, opaque appointment processes of investigators, and a lack of measures to ensure confidentiality and security of victims and witnesses. Victims also have expressed concern that investigators in many districts have asked about their interest in reconciliation. The constitution prohibits torture, and the criminal code criminalizes torture and enumerates punishment for torture. The Torture Compensation Act provides for compensation for victims of torture. According to human rights activists and legal experts, police resorted to severe abuse, primarily beatings, to force confessions. Local human rights NGO Advocacy Forum-Nepal (AF) reported no evidence of major changes in police abuse trends across the country, but AF stated that police increasingly complied with the courts’ demand for preliminary medical checks of detainees. Both AF and the Terai Human Rights Defenders Alliance (THRDA), another local NGO, stated that torture victims often were hesitant to file complaints due to police or other official intimidation and fear of retribution. In some cases, victims settled out of court under pressure from the perpetrators. AF and THRDA said the courts ultimately dismissed many cases of alleged torture due to a lack of credible supporting evidence, especially medical documentation. In cases where courts awarded compensation or ordered disciplinary action against police, the decisions were rarely implemented, according to THRDA and other NGOs. THRDA reported in 2017 that 34 percent of the detainees they interviewed were held in police detention centers in the country’s southern Terai belt and had been subjected to some form of physical or mental abuse. According to the Nepal Police human rights section (HRS), many alleged incidents were not formally reported or investigated by any police authorities. There have been no cases brought to the criminal justice system of torture committed during the civil conflict. Prison conditions, especially those in pretrial detention centers, were poor and did not meet international standards, according to human rights groups. Physical Conditions: There was overcrowding in the prison system. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) reported that in its nationwide assessment of prisons, facilities held nearly twice the inmate population of designed capacity. THRDA stated that overcrowding also remained a serious problem in detention centers. According to the OAG report, most prisons and detention centers had sufficient windows, daylight, and ventilation, with a few exceptions. Some facilities held pretrial detainees with convicted prisoners. Due to a lack of adequate juvenile detention facilities, authorities sometimes incarcerated pretrial detainee children with adults or allowed children to remain in jails with their incarcerated parents. The OAG reported that prisoners and detainees in the 31 detention centers it monitored had been deprived of regular medical check-up and treatment. According to THRDA, most prisons lacked separate facilities for women, children, and persons with disabilities. According to AF medical examinations for detainees generally were perfunctory and medical care was poor for detainees with serious conditions. AF reported that some detainees slept on the floor due to lack of beds and had access only to unfiltered and dirty water and inadequate food, and many detention centers had poor ventilation, lighting, heating, and bedding. Administration: Authorities including the OAG conducted investigations of allegations of mistreatment (see above). Independent Monitoring: The government generally allowed prison and pretrial detention center visits by the OAG, NHRC, the National Women’s Commission, and the National Dalit Commission as well as by lawyers of the accused. THRDA and AF reported that they and some other NGOs often were prevented from meeting with detainees or accessing detention facilities, although some independent human rights observers, including the United Nations and international organizations, were given such access. Media had no access to prisons or detention centers. The NHRC could request government action, but authorities often denied such requests. The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, but security forces reportedly conducted arbitrary arrests during the year. The law gives chief district officers wide latitude to make arrests, and human rights groups contended that police abused their 24-hour detention authority by holding persons unlawfully, in some cases without proper access to counsel, food, and medicine, or in inadequate facilities. The law stipulates that, except in cases involving suspected security and narcotics violations, or when the crime’s punishment would be more than three years’ imprisonment, authorities must obtain an arrest warrant and present the suspect to a court within 24 hours of arrest (not including travel time). If the court upholds a detention, the law generally authorizes police to hold the suspect for up to 25 days to complete an investigation and file a criminal charge sheet. In special cases, that timeframe is extended. For narcotics violations, a suspect can be held for up to 90 days; for suspected acts of corruption, six months. Human rights monitors expressed concern that the law vests too much discretionary power in local authorities. The constitution provides for access to a state-appointed lawyer or one of the detainee’s choice, even if charges have not been filed. Few detainees can afford their own lawyer, and the justice system does not receive sufficient funding to provide free and competent counsel to indigent defendants. There are, however, independent organizations providing free legal services to a limited number of detainees accused of criminal violations. Detainees have the legal right to receive visits by family members, but family access to prisoners varied from prison to prison. Authorities routinely denied defense attorneys access to defendants in custody. A functioning bail system exists; the accused have the option of posting bail in cash or mortgaging their property to the court. Unless prisoners are released on recognizance (no bail), no alternatives to the bail system exist to assure a defendant’s appearance in court. Arbitrary Arrest: The human rights NGO Informal Sector Service Center documented 247 incidents of arbitrary arrest (without timely warrant presentation) from January to June but attributed the comparative increase during the year to greater attention toward Biplav Maoist security threats. Pretrial Detention: Time served is credited to a prisoner’s sentence, but pretrial detention occasionally exceeded the length of the ultimate sentence following trial and conviction. Under the Public Security Act, security forces may detain persons who allegedly threaten domestic security and tranquility, amicable relations with other countries, or relations between citizens of different castes or religious groups. The government may detain persons in preventive detention for as long as 12 months without charging them with a crime as long as the detention complies with the act’s requirements. The courts do not have any substantive legal role in preventive detentions under the act. According to human rights groups, in some cases detainees appeared before judicial authorities well after the legally mandated 24-hour limit, allegedly to allow injuries from police mistreatment to heal. AF estimated in 2018 that 14 percent of detainees did not appear before judicial authorities within 24 hours of their arrests, down from 41 percent in 2015. THRDA stated police frequently circumvented the 24-hour requirement by registering the detainee’s name only when they were ready to produce the detainee before the court. The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, but courts remained vulnerable to political pressure, bribery, and intimidation. The law provides for the right to counsel, equal protection under the law, protection from double jeopardy, protection from retroactive application of the law, public trials, and the right to be present at one’s own trial, but these rights were not always upheld. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence, except in some cases, such as human trafficking and drug trafficking, where the burden of proof is on the defendant once the charge sheet establishes a prima facie criminal violation. The law provides detainees the right to legal representation and a court-appointed lawyer, a government lawyer, or access to private attorneys. The government provided legal counsel to indigent detainees only upon request. Persons who are unaware of their rights, in particular “lower-caste” individuals and members of some ethnic groups, are thus at risk of being deprived of legal representation. Defense lawyers reported having insufficient time to prepare their defense. A 2016 Supreme Court directive ordered that the courts must provide free interpretation services to those who do not speak Nepali, and interpreters were made available to interpret a variety of languages. Defense lawyers may cross-examine accusers. All lower-court decisions, including acquittals, are subject to appeal. The Supreme Court is the court of last resort. Military courts adjudicate cases concerning military personnel under the military code, which provides military personnel the same basic rights as civilians. The Army Act requires that soldiers accused of rape or homicide be transferred to civilian authorities for prosecution. Under normal circumstances the army prosecutes all other criminal cases raised against soldiers under the military justice system. Nevertheless, the NA has told the government it is willing to cooperate with the Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC) and CIEDP. Military courts cannot try civilians for crimes, even if the crimes involve the military services; civilian courts handle these cases. There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees. Individuals or organizations could seek remedies for human rights violations in national courts. The Maoists and their affiliate organizations have returned some previously seized property as required by the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Accord that ended the civil conflict, but they kept other illegally seized lands and properties. According to The Asia Foundation, a significant number of conflict-era land and other property disputes remained outstanding, particularly in Provinces 1, 5, and 7. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence and there were no reports that the government failed to respect these provisions. The law allows police to conduct searches and seizures without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, in which case a search may be conducted as long as two or more persons of “good character” are present. If a police officer has reasonable cause to believe that a suspect may possess material evidence, the officer must submit a written request to another officer to conduct a search, and there must be another official present who holds at least the rank of assistant subinspector. Some legal experts claimed that by excluding prosecutors and judges from the warrant procedure, there are relatively few checks against police abuse of discretionary authority. The constitution and the law provide for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights, although journalists, NGOs, and political activists said the government restricted media freedom by threatening journalists and news organizations that criticized the government. Journalists and NGOs said the criminal and civil codes and Privacy Act criminalize normal media activity, such as reporting on public figures, and triggered a significant increase in self-censorship by the media. Human rights lawyers and some journalists stated that both the constitution and civil code enable the government to restrict freedom of speech and press in ways they considered vague and open to abuse. For example, the constitution lists several circumstances under which laws curtailing freedom of speech and press may be formulated. These include acts that “jeopardize harmonious relations between federal units” and acts that assist a foreign state or organization to jeopardize national security. The constitution prohibits any acts “contrary to public health, decency, and morality” or that “disturb the public law and order situation.” Freedom of Expression: Citizens generally believed they could voice their opinions freely and often expressed critical opinions in print and electronic media without restriction. In February a popular folk singer released a satirical song criticizing government corruption; the singer removed his song from YouTube after allegedly receiving threats from the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s youth organization. In July the government attempted to limit freedom of expression for the members of Kathmandu’s Tibetan community by initially rejecting requests from the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office to celebrate the Dalai Lama’s birthday publicly. When Tibetan Buddhists held private events in the largest settlement in Kathmandu, police intervened to stop the celebration. On December 12, the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office was allowed to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Dalai Lama’s receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in Dhagkar Monastery, Swoyambhu following discussions with the Swoyambhu police officials. Press and Media, Including Online Media: The independent media were active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction, with some exceptions. Several editors and journalists reported they faced intimidation by police and government officials and that vague provisions in laws and regulations prompted an increase in self-censorship by journalists. Violence and Harassment: According to the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ), the government did not make sufficient efforts to preserve the safety and independence of the media and rarely prosecuted individuals who attacked journalists. Journalists stated that they continued to receive vague threats from officials in response to their investigative reporting on corruption. In June a ward chair in Birgunj attacked campaigner Piraj Yadav for requesting road construction costs under right to information provisions. Censorship or Content Restrictions: The constitution prohibits prior censorship of material for printing, publication or broadcasting, including electronically. The constitution also provides that the government cannot revoke media licenses, close media houses, or seize material based on the content of what is printed, published, or broadcast. The constitution, however, also provides for “reasonable restrictions” of these rights for acts or incitement that “may undermine the sovereignty, territorial integrity, nationality of Nepal, or harmonious relations between the federal units or harmonious relations between the various castes, tribes, religions, or communities.” Speech amounting to treason, defamation, or contempt of court is also prohibited. Media professionals expressed concern regarding an additional provision in the constitution that allows the government to formulate laws to regulate media. The criminal code, for example, extends the scope of limitation on freedom of expression compared to the language in the constitution for national security and for maintaining public order, and defines defamation as a criminal offense. The FNJ argued that such laws could be used to close media houses or cancel their registration. The constitution also includes publication and dissemination of false materials as grounds for imposing legal restrictions on press freedom. Media experts reported, however, that these provisions were not enforced against any media houses. Although by law all media outlets, including government-owned stations, operate independently from direct government control, indirect political influence sometimes led to self-censorship. Libel/Slander Laws: In June authorities jailed a satirist for defamation under the Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) after he lampooned a Nepali film on social media. Widespread public protests ensued, and authorities released him after nine days; he was acquitted of all charges in court. There were several incidents in which authorities took action under the ETA in response to material posted on social media. The ETA prohibits publication in electronic form of material that may be “contrary to the public morality or decent behavior,” may “spread hate or jealousy,” or may “jeopardize harmonious relations.” In 2017 the government issued an amended online media operation directive, which requires all domestically based online news and opinion websites to be registered. The directive gives the government the authority to block websites based on content if it lacks an “authoritative source,” creates “a misconception,” or negatively affects international relationships. The government also has the authority to block content that threatens the country’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, nationality, or harmonious relations. Online sedition, defamation, contempt of court, or indecent and immoral content may also be blocked. The new version makes the registration, license renewal, and content production provisions for online platforms more complicated, including by requiring a copy of a site’s value added tax or permanent account number registration certificate. Renewals now require online platforms to provide updated human resource and payroll records annually. The FNJ expressed concern that the directive’s vague language gives the government power to censor online content. Human rights and press freedom NGO Freedom Forum reported more than 100 cases filed in court, mostly related to the ETA. In April online reporter Arjun Giri was briefly jailed for writing about a businessman’s alleged financial fraud; he was officially absolved of wrongdoing in August. The law provides for the freedom to hold cultural events. There were no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events, with the exception of events in the Tibetan community, which faced restrictions (see section 2.b.). The law provides for the freedoms of assembly and association; however, the government sometimes restricted freedom of assembly. Freedom of assembly generally was respected for citizens and legal residents, but there were some restrictions. Government permits are required to hold large public events. The government continued its attempts to stop Tibetans from celebrating culturally important events, such as Tibetan New Year and the Dalai Lama’s birthday. The law authorizes chief district officers to impose curfews when there is a possibility that demonstrations or riots could disturb the peace. In June large protests erupted in Kathmandu against a bill, since withdrawn, to nationalize the administration of Guthis, community-run land ownership organizations. The gathering was the largest since the antimonarchy movement during 2006-2007. Police exhibited restraint and there were no reports of violence. The law provides for freedom of association, and the government generally respected this right. NGOs, however, stated the existing legal framework does not adequately recognize the independence of civil society and opens the door to the exercise of excessive discretion by the government. They added that the registration process for civil society organizations (CSOs) is restrictive and cumbersome, the government has wide discretion to deny registration, and requirements vary among various registration authorities, with some entities requiring documents not mentioned in existing laws on an ad hoc basis. Additionally, the Association Registration Act empowers the government to give directions to associations and to terminate associations if they refuse to follow directions. To receive foreign or government resources, CSOs must seek separate and additional approval from the Social Welfare Council (SWC), the government entity responsible for overseeing CSOs. The SWC requires that CSOs allocate at least 80 percent of their budgets for hardware or tangible development outputs, which places undue restrictions on CSOs that focus on advocacy issues. See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report at https://www.state.gov/religiousfreedomreport/. The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, except for most refugees, whose freedom of movement within the country is limited by law. Constraints on refugee movements were enforced unevenly. The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees and asylum seekers except as noted below. In-country Movement: The government has not issued personal identification documents to Tibetan refugees in more than 20 years, leaving the majority of this refugee population without recourse to present required documents at police checkpoints or during police stops. Some refugees reported being harassed or turned back by police at checkpoints. Foreign Travel: In an attempt to protect women from being exploited in trafficking or otherwise abused in overseas employment, the government maintained a minimum age of 24 for women traveling overseas for domestic employment. NGOs and human rights activists viewed the age ban as discriminatory and counterproductive because it impelled some women to migrate through informal channels across the Indian border rendering them more vulnerable to exploitation. The 2015 earthquake and its aftershocks displaced millions of individuals. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, natural disasters in 2018 led to 12,000 displacements. Many earthquake-affected IDPs remained in camps or informal settlements because they did not hold a title to land and were occupying it illegally when the earthquake occurred. Others stayed because their homes remained vulnerable to or were destroyed by subsequent landslides. The government promoted their safe, voluntary return and had policies in place to help them. Although the government and the Maoists agreed to support the voluntary, safe, and dignified return of conflict-displaced IDPs to their homes following the 10-year civil war, the agreement has not been fully implemented. The Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction estimated that 78,700 persons were displaced from 1996 to 2006, but an estimated 50,000 remained unwilling or unable to return home. The reasons included unresolved land and property issues, lack of citizenship or ownership documentation, and security concerns since the land taken from IDPs by Maoists during the conflict was often sold or given to landless or tenant farmers. The government provided relief packages for the rehabilitation and voluntary return of conflict-era IDPs. Many of those still displaced preferred to integrate locally and live in urban areas, mostly as illegal occupants of government land along riversides or together with the landless population. The absence of public services and lack of livelihood assistance also impeded the return of IDPs. Access to Asylum: The law does not provide for the determination of individual refugee or asylum claims or a comprehensive legal framework for refugee protection. The government recognized large numbers of Tibetans as refugees and supported resettlement to foreign countries of certain Bhutanese refugees. The government does not recognize Tibetans who arrived in the country after 1990 as refugees. Most Tibetans who arrived since then transited to India, although an unknown number remained in the country. The government has not issued refugee cards to Tibetan refugees since 1995. UNHCR estimated three-quarters of the approximately 12,000 resident Tibetan refugees remained undocumented, including all of whom were younger than the age of 16 in 1995 or had been born since. UNHCR reported 639 refugees and 49 asylum seekers from other countries, including Pakistan, Burma, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, and Democratic Republic of the Congo, lived in the country. The government continued to deny these groups recognition as refugees, even when recognized as such by UNHCR. Freedom of Movement: The government officially restricted freedom of movement and work for the approximately 6,500 refugees with claims to Bhutanese residency or citizenship residing in the two remaining refugee camps in the eastern part of the country, but those restrictions were largely unenforced for this population. After China heightened security in 2008 along its border and increased restrictions on internal freedom of movement for ethnic Tibetans, the number of Tibetans who transited through the country dropped significantly. UNHCR reported that 53 Tibetans transited the country in 2017, 45 in 2018, and 10 as of September. The government previously issued UNHCR-facilitated exit permits for recent arrivals from Tibet who were transiting while traveling to India but ceased doing so. While Nepal-based Tibetans with refugee certificates were eligible to apply for travel documents to leave the country, the legal process was often arduous, expensive, and opaque and travel documents were typically valid for one year and a single trip. A 2016 government directive authorized chief district officers to skip the verification step, which required witnesses and a police letter, for Tibetans who had previously been issued a travel document. For individuals whom the government did not recognize as refugees, even when recognized by UNHCR, the government levied fines of $5 per day out of status and a discretionary penalty of up to $500 to obtain an exit permit. The government maintained its policy enabling Nepali government-registered refugees destined for resettlement or repatriation to obtain exit permits without paying these fines. Access to Basic Services: Most Tibetan refugees who lived in the country, particularly those who arrived after 1990 or turned 16 after 1995, did not have documentation, nor did their locally born children. Even those with acknowledged refugee status had no legal rights beyond the ability to remain in the country. The Nepal-born children of Tibetans with legal status often lacked documentation. The government allowed NGOs to provide primary- and secondary-level schooling to Tibetans living ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 driver’s licenses, bank accounts, or to own property. NGOs reported an improvement in refugees’ ability to obtain civil registration documents, although some refugees continued to experience difficulties documenting births, marriages, and deaths. Some in the Tibetan community resorted to bribery to obtain these services. The government allowed UNHCR to provide some education, health, and livelihood services to these urban refugees, but refugees lacked legal access to public education and the right to work. Durable Solutions: The government does not provide for local integration as a durable solution. The government officially does not allow the approximately 6,500 refugees with claims to Bhutanese residency or citizenship to work or have access to public education or public health clinics, but it previously allowed UNHCR to provide parallel free education and health services to refugees in the camps. During the year new local authorities were allowing Bhutanese children access to public schools on an ad hoc basis. Since 2007 the government permitted third-country resettlement for more than 113,000 Bhutanese refugees. An estimated six million individuals lacked citizenship documentation, although the majority of these would be eligible for citizenship under local law. Citizenship documents, which are issued at age 16, are required to register to vote, register marriages or births, buy or sell land, appear for professional exams, open bank accounts, or gain access to credit and receive state social benefits. Constitutional provisions, laws, and regulations governing citizenship discriminated by the gender of the registering parent, which contributed to statelessness. Stateless persons experienced discrimination in employment, education, housing, health services, marriage, birth registration, identity documentation, access to courts and judicial procedures, migration opportunities, land and property ownership, and access to earthquake relief and reconstruction programs. Recent Elections: The government held parliamentary, provincial, and local assembly elections over five phases throughout 2017. International observers indicated that these parliamentary and provincial assembly elections were generally well conducted, despite some violent incidents, and logistical and operational challenges, including a notable lack of transparency and adequate voter education by the ECN, which affected the electoral process. According to domestic observer groups, the elections were free, fair, and peaceful and saw high voter turnout. There were three reports, however, of individuals being killed by police and sporadic reports of interparty clashes or assaults, vandalism, and small explosive devices and hoax bombs. Participation of Women and Minorities: No laws explicitly limit participation of women or minorities in the political process, and they did participate in local, provincial, and national elections. The constitution mandates proportional inclusion of women in all state bodies and allocates one third of all federal and provincial legislative seats to women; LGBTI activists noted that this mandate excludes nonbinary candidates from running for office. The CIAA expanded its investigative scope in 2018 to include a civil engineering lab to determine the quality of materials used in public infrastructure, a common target for systemic corrupt cost cutting. During the year the CIAA conducted 97 sting operations which facilitated the arrest of 154 civil servants, including a senior civil servant. As in previous years, student and labor groups associated with political parties demanded contributions from schools and businesses. Corruption remained problematic within the Nepal Police and APF. Financial Disclosure: Public officials are subject to financial disclosure laws and the vast majority of civil servants complied with the requirement. Despite the required financial disclosures, the National Vigilance Center, the body mandated to monitor financial disclosures and make them publicly available, generally did not systematically review its findings or publish these details. The Nepal Police and APF each have an HRS and the NA has a human rights directorate (HRD). The NA HRD and Nepal Police HRS have independent investigative powers. The NA’s investigations were not fully transparent according to human rights NGOs. The government and judiciary have not significantly addressed conflict-era human rights and humanitarian law violations committed by the NA, Nepal Police, APF, and Maoist parties. There were significant delays in implementing and granting full independence to the country’s two transitional justice mechanisms, CIEDP and the TRC. Human rights experts continue to report that neither of the mechanisms have made significant progress on investigations or reporting. The CIEDP and TRC commissioners’ tenure expired in April without having fulfilled their mandate and new commissioners had to be appointed as of December. Local human rights advocates cite legal shortcomings that pose obstacles to a comprehensive and credible transitional justice process in the country. For example, the law does not retroactively criminalize torture or enforced disappearance, and the statute of limitations for rape is only 180 days. Additionally, the law does not specifically recognize war crimes or crimes against humanity, although the constitution recognizes as law treaties to which the country is a party. Critics also cite instances in which parliament failed to implement Supreme Court decisions. For example, in a 2015 ruling, the court nullified provisions of the TRC and CIEDP Act that would have granted the commissions discretionary power to recommend amnesty for serious crimes because amnesty would violate the then interim constitution and international obligations. As of September, parliament had not amended the act to bring it in line with the Supreme Court decision, although the CIEDP commissions have stated they intend to abide by the court’s rulings. Rape and Domestic Violence: Rape, including marital rape, is illegal, with minimum prison sentences that vary between five and 15 years, depending on the victim’s age. The law also mandates five years’ additional imprisonment in the case of gang rape, rape of pregnant women, or rape of a woman with disabilities. The victim’s compensation depends on the degree of mental and physical abuse. Police and the courts were responsive in most cases when rape was reported, although several high-profile cases highlighted the government’s failure to secure justice for rape victims. In July 2018, 13-year-old Nirmala Panta was raped and killed in Kanchanpur district. A government panel that reviewed the police response found that investigators acted with grave negligence and destroyed key evidence in the case. In March the district court charged eight police personnel for tampering with evidence. As of September the case was unresolved. Human rights activists outside of Kathmandu expressed concern that police frequently refuse to register cases of gender-based violence, including occasionally rape cases. These groups reported that police often preferred to use mediation rather than criminal investigation to resolve conflicts. On October 1, allegations of rape against Speaker of Federal Parliament Krishna Bahadur Mahara led to his resignation at the request of Prime Minister Oli and the ruling Nepal Communist Party. As of November Mahara remained in police custody pending trial. Domestic violence against women and girls remained a serious problem. NGOs reported that violence against women and girls, including early and forced marriage, was one of the major factors responsible for women’s relatively poor health, livelihood insecurity, and inadequate social mobilization and contributed to intergenerational poverty. The law allows for settling complaints of domestic violence through mediation with an emphasis on reconciliation. Authorities usually pursued prosecution under the act only when mediation failed. The Nepal Police had women’s cells staffed by female officers in each of the country’s 77 districts to make it easier for women and girls to report crimes to police. According to the women and children service directorate, some women’s cells were not fully operational, but the Nepal Police, with assistance from foreign governments and NGOs, endeavored to build and improve their infrastructure and capacity. NGOs stated that despite improvements, resources and training to deal with victims of domestic violence and trafficking were insufficient. Although police guidelines call on officers to treat domestic violence as a criminal offense, this guidance was difficult to implement outside of the women’s cells due to entrenched discriminatory attitudes. The government maintained service centers in 17 districts, rehabilitation centers in eight districts, and hospital-based one-stop crisis management centers in 17 districts to provide treatment, protection, and psychosocial and legal support for survivors of gender-based violence. Gender experts said the service centers have improved coordination among police, NHRC, National Women’s Commission, chief district officers, local authorities, community mediation centers, and NGOs working to address violence against women and girls. Other Harmful Traditional Practices: The constitution criminalizes violence against or oppression of women based on religious, social, or cultural traditions and gives victims the right to compensation. The criminal code makes the practice of paying dowries illegal and imposes penalties of up to NRs 30,000 ($300), prison sentences of up to three years, or both. The legislation also criminalizes violence committed against one’s spouse in connection to a dowry, imposing fines of up to NRs 50,000 ($500), prison sentences of up to five years, or both. Additionally, the law stipulates that any psychological abuse of women, including asking for dowry, humiliation, physical torture, and shunning women for not providing a dowry, is punishable. Nevertheless, according to NGOs, dowries remained common, especially in the Terai region. Additionally, the practice of early and forced marriage, which remained prevalent, limited girls’ access to education and increased their susceptibility to domestic violence and sexual abuse, including sex trafficking. Early and forced marriages were especially common in the Dalit and Madhesi communities (see “Children” section). Government agencies documented incidents of dowry-related violence and forced marriage, recommended interventions, and occasionally rescued victims and offered them rehabilitation services. Traditional beliefs about witchcraft negatively affected rural women, especially widows, the elderly, persons of low economic status, or members of the Dalit caste, despite a law specifically criminalizing discrimination and violence against those accused of witchcraft. There were no reported prosecutions under the law. Media and NGOs reported some cases of violence against alleged witches, and civil society organizations raised public awareness of the problem. The law criminalizes acid attacks. The NGO Burns Violence Survivors Nepal documented two acid attacks from January to September. The practice of “chhaupadi” (expelling women and girls from their homes during menstruation and sometimes following childbirth, including forcing women and girls to reside in cattle sheds) continued to be a serious problem despite a 2005 Supreme Court decision and 2008 guidelines from the Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare outlawing the practice. In 2018 a law that formally criminalized the practice went into effect; it stipulates a punishment of up to three months’ imprisonment, a maximum fine of NRs 3,000 ($30), or both. Some local officials implemented various efforts to eliminate chhaupadi, including education campaigns and physical destruction of sheds, but stigma and tradition maintained the practice, particularly in rural western districts, where women periodically died from exposure to the elements. For example, local media reported that in January a woman died from exposure in her menstruation hut in Achham district, and two days later, a mother and her two children died of smoke inhalation while sleeping in her hut. On December 5, Nepal Police arrested an individual reportedly involved in the death of a woman in a menstruation hut, the first arrest of its kind since adoption of the 2018 law. Sexual Harassment: The law allows the top administrative official in a district to impose up to six months imprisonment, a maximum fine of NRs 50,000 ($500), or both, against a perpetrator, once a series of internal workplace processes to address a complaint have been exhausted. According to women’s rights activists, the law provides adequate protective measures and compensation for victims, but the penalties are insufficiently severe and the law does not cover the informal sector, where sexual harassment is most common. Coercion in Population Control: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization. Discrimination: Although the law provides protection, women faced systemic discrimination, including in employment (see section 7.d.) and especially in rural areas. Dalit women in particular faced gender and caste discrimination. The law grants women equal shares of their parents’ inheritance and the right to keep their property after marriage, but many women were not aware of their rights, and others were afraid to challenge existing practice. The law also grants widows complete access and authority to the estate of their deceased husbands; the government did not take sufficient measures to enforce these provisions. The Gender Equality Act adopted in 2006–along with more than 60 other laws–contains discriminatory provisions. For example, the law on property rights favors men in land tenancy and the division of family property. The constitution, however, confers rights for women that had not previously received legal protection, including rights equal to those of their spouses in property and family affairs, and special opportunities in education, health, and social security. The constitution does not allow women to convey citizenship to their children independent of the citizenship of the child’s father and has no specific provision for naturalization of foreign husbands married to citizen wives. For women and girls to obtain citizenship by descent for themselves, regulations require a married woman to submit a formal attestation from her husband, father, or husband’s family (if widowed) that she qualifies for citizenship and has his or their permission to receive it. This requirement makes a woman’s right to citizenship contingent on her father’s or husband’s cooperation. In many cases husbands refused to provide their wives this attestation. Preventing women from obtaining citizenship documentation precludes their access to the courts and thus their ability to make legal claims to land and other property, which permits the husband or male relatives free to stake their own claims. Birth Registration: Constitutional provisions, laws, and regulations governing citizenship discriminated by the gender of the parent, which contributed to statelessness (see section 2.d., Statelessness). There was no difference in birth registration policies and procedures based on the sex of the child. The constitution states that citizenship derives from one citizen parent, but it also stipulates that a child born to a citizen mother and a noncitizen father may obtain citizenship only through naturalization. In some cases, mothers faced extreme difficulties in securing citizenship papers for children of citizen parents, even when the mother possessed citizenship documents, except in cases in which the child’s father supported the application. These difficulties persisted despite a 2011 Supreme Court decision granting a child citizenship through the mother if the father was unknown or absent. The constitution states that the children of unidentified fathers may obtain citizenship through their mothers, but if it is later determined that the father is a foreign citizen, the child will lose citizenship by descent but be eligible for naturalization. In practice many single women face difficulties registering their children as citizens by descent. The Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that government authorities must not deny the registration of birth and citizenship of children of citizen mothers and fathers who cannot be traced. According to human rights lawyers, although this provision applies to the children of single mothers, including rape and trafficking victims, it does not address situations in which the identity of a child’s father is known but he refuses to acknowledge paternity. The legal and practical restrictions on transferring citizenship imposed particular hardships on children whose fathers were deceased, had abandoned the family, or (as was increasingly common) departed the country to work abroad. Since naturalization is not a fundamental right under the constitution, although it could be an option for those not eligible for citizenship by descent, it is subject to state discretion. Although they lack specific data, human rights lawyers reported that the government has processed few applications for naturalization of children in recent years. Education: The constitution makes basic primary education free and compulsory nationwide. The law divides the education system into Basic Education (Early Childhood Development and grades one to eight), which is free and compulsory, and Secondary Education (grades nine to 12), which is free but not compulsory. The government reported that during the 2017-18 school year, 97.2 percent of school-age children attended primary schools with gender parity. A gender gap in secondary education persisted, with two-thirds of adolescent girls in rural areas reportedly not attending school. Some children, particularly girls, face barriers to accessing education due to lack of sanitation facilities, geographic distance, costs associated with schooling, household chores, and lack of parental support. Countrywide, 32.4 percent of schools lack separate toilet facilities for girls, which can deter them from attending school, especially when they are menstruating. Barriers for attending school for school-age boys include pressure to find employment, migration to work outside the country, and issues with drugs and alcohol. Children with disabilities face additional barriers to accessing education, including denial of school admission. In addition, children are required to attend school only up to age 13. This standard makes children age 13 and older vulnerable to child labor despite not being legally permitted to work. Medical Care: The government provided basic health care free to children and adults although parental discrimination against girls often resulted in impoverished parents giving priority to their sons when seeking medical services. Child Abuse: Violence against children, including sexual abuse, was reportedly widespread. NGOs stated that such reports have increased in part due to greater awareness, but no reliable estimates of its incidence exist. The government has some mechanisms to respond to child abuse and violence against children, such as special hotlines and the National Child Rights Council. Early and Forced Marriage: The law prohibits marriage for both boys and girls before the age of 20, but the country has a high rate of child marriage. According to UNICEF, more than a third of young women aged 20-24 reported they were married by the age of 18, and approximately 10 percent by age 15. Social, economic, and cultural values promoted the practice of early and forced marriages, which was especially common in the Dalit and Madhesi communities. The law sets penalties for violations according to the age of the girls involved in child marriage. The penalty includes both a prison sentence and fine, with the fees collected going to the girl involved. The civil code provides that the government must act whenever a case of child marriage is filed with authorities. Sexual Exploitation of Children: Commercial sexual exploitation of children remained a serious problem, according to NGOs. There were reports of boys and girls living on the streets and exploited in prostitution, including by tourists, and of underage girls employed in dance bars, massage parlors, and cabin restaurants (sometimes fronts for brothels). Enforcement was generally weak due to limited police investigation and capacity, and police sometimes arrested girls in commercial sexual exploitation. The minimum age for consensual sex is 18 years. The penalties for rape vary according to the age of the victim and the relationship. There is no specific law against child pornography, but the law stipulates that no person can involve or use a child for an immoral profession, and photographs cannot be taken or distributed for the purpose of engaging a child in an immoral profession. Additionally, photographs that tarnish the character of the child may not be published, exhibited, or distributed. The legal framework, however, does not explicitly prohibit the use of a child in the production of pornography. Displaced Children: Many children remained displaced due to the 2015 earthquake and its aftershocks (see section 2.d.). The government did not have comprehensive data on children affected by the decade-long Maoist conflict, including the original number of internally displaced and the number who remained displaced. Institutionalized Children: Abuse, including sexual abuse, and mistreatment in orphanages and children’s homes reportedly was common. An NGO working in this field estimated that approximately one-third of registered children’s homes met the minimum legal standards of operation, but there is no reliable data on the many unregistered homes. NGOs reported some children in the institutions were forced to beg. The NGO also reported no significant change in the level or degree of abuse of children compared to previous years. International Child Abductions: The country is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. See the Department of State’s Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html. There was a small Jewish community in the country, and there were no reports of anti-Semitic acts. See the Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/. The constitution prohibits discrimination based on disability or physical condition and contains additional specific rights for persons with disabilities. These include the right to free higher education for all physically disabled citizens who are “financially poor” and the provision of special instructional materials and curricula for persons with vision disabilities. The government provides services for persons with physical and mental disabilities, including a monthly stipend, building shelters, and appointing one social welfare worker in each of 753 local governments. In 2017 parliament passed the Disability Rights Act, which provides that persons with disabilities have equal access to education, health, employment, public physical infrastructure, transportation, and information and communication services. The act also prohibits discrimination based on disability. Although government efforts to enforce laws and regulations to improve rights and benefits for persons with disabilities gradually improved, they still were not fully effective. For example, books printed in Braille were not available for students at all grade levels, and free higher education was not uniformly available to all interested persons with disability. According to the Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens, the government did “no additional work” in this area during the year. The government provided monthly social security allowances for persons with disabilities of NRs 2,000 ($20) for those categorized as “profoundly” disabled, and NRs 600 ($6) for the “severely” disabled. The law states that other persons with disabilities should receive allowances based on the availability of funds and the degree of disability. Three provincial governments funded sign language interpreters in 20 districts to assist persons with hearing disabilities in obtaining government services. The government allocated approximately NRs 90 million ($900,000) from the national budget to fund programs for persons with disabilities, including grants to several disability-related organizations and a minimum budget to pay for community-based rehabilitation in all 77 districts. The Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens was responsible for the protection of persons with disabilities. Compared with primary school attendance, relatively few children with disabilities attended higher levels of education, largely due to accessibility problems, school locations, and financial burdens on parents. Although abuse of children with disabilities reportedly occurred in schools, no reports of such incidents were filed in the courts or with the relevant agencies during the year. The Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens reported that most of the 753 municipalities have allocated funding to minority and vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities, under the new federal system. Most persons with disabilities had to rely almost exclusively on family members for assistance. There are no restrictions in law on the rights of persons with disabilities to vote and participate in civic affairs or to access the judicial system. According to the Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens, however, there were obstacles to exercising these rights, especially the lack of accessibility to public facilities. The law provides that each community shall have the right “to preserve and promote its language, script, and culture” and to operate schools at the primary level in its native language. The government generally upheld these provisions. More than 125 caste and ethnic groups, some of which are considered indigenous nationalities, speak more than 120 different languages. Discrimination against lower castes and some ethnic groups, including in employment (see section 7.d.), was widespread and especially common in the Terai region and in rural areas. Caste-based discrimination is illegal, and the government outlawed the public shunning of Dalits and made an effort to protect the rights of other disadvantaged castes. The constitution prohibits the practice of untouchability and stipulates special legal protections for Dalits in education, health care, and housing. It also established the National Dalit Commission as a constitutional body to strengthen protections for and promote the rights of Dalits. While the government promulgated the accompanying laws to prohibit discrimination in late 2018, Dalit rights activists maintained that the laws banned discrimination too generally without explicitly protecting Dalits. According to the Nepal National Dalit Social Welfare Organization, government progress in reducing discrimination remained limited in rural areas. The government recognized 59 ethnic/caste groups as indigenous nationalities, comprising approximately 36 percent of the population. Although some communities were comparatively privileged, many faced unequal access to government resources and political institutions and linguistic, religious, and cultural discrimination. No laws criminalize same-sex sexual activity, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons actively advocated for their rights. The constitution contains provisions outlining protections for LGBTI persons, but LGBTI activists continued to press for further legislation to increase protections for gender and sexual minorities. According to local LGBTI advocacy groups, the government did not provide equal opportunities for LGBTI persons in education, health care, or employment (see section 7.d.). Additionally, advocacy groups stated that some LGBTI persons faced difficulties in registering for citizenship, particularly in rural areas. Although several LGBTI candidates ran for office in local elections in recent years, LGBTI activists noted that election authorities prevented one person in 2017 who self-identified as third gender from registering as a candidate for vice mayor because electoral quotas required the individual’s party to register a “female” candidate for the position; the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government. Separately, LGBTI activists stated that some transgender persons refrained from voting out of fear of harassment or social scorn because transgender persons were forced to stand in lines reflecting the gender on their citizenship documents, regardless of whether they had changed gender in practice. According to LGBTI rights NGOs, harassment and abuse of LGBTI persons by private citizens and government officials declined during the year, especially in urban areas, although such incidents still occurred. LGBTI rights groups reported that gender and sexual minorities faced harassment from police during the year. The Nepal Police HRS confirmed that some low-level harassment occurred because many citizens held negative views of LGBTI persons. The HRS added that the Nepal Police were not immune to such social prejudices. There was no official discrimination against persons who provided HIV-prevention services or against high-risk groups that could spread HIV/AIDS. Societal discrimination and stigma against persons with HIV remained common, according to NGOs. The law provides for the right of workers to form and join unions of their choice, except those organizations deemed by the government to be subversive or seditious. Freedom of association extends to workers in both the formal and informal sectors. Noncitizens cannot be elected as trade union officials. Local workers have the right to strike and bargain collectively, except for employees in essential services, including public transportation, banking, security, and health care. The Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Act approved in August 2016 prohibits workers from striking in any SEZ. The government is developing the country’s first two special economic zones in Bhairahawa and Simara, both in the portion of the country near the Indian border. Members of the armed forces, police, and government officials at the undersecretary level or higher also are prohibited from taking part in union activities. In the private sector, employees in managerial positions are not permitted to join unions. The law stipulates that unions must represent at least 25 percent of workers in a given workplace to be considered representative. The minimum requirement does not prohibit the formation of unofficial union groups, which under certain conditions may call strikes and enter into direct negotiation with the government. Workers in the informal sector may also form unions, but many workers were not aware of these rights. The law also protects union representatives from adverse legal action arising from their official union duties, including collective bargaining, and prohibits antiunion discrimination. Workers dismissed for engaging in union activities can seek reinstatement by filing a complaint in labor court or with the Department of Labor, which has semijudicial and mediation authority. Most cases are settled through mediation. By law employers can fire workers only under limited conditions and only after three instances of misconduct. The law stipulates that participation in a strike that does not meet legal requirements constitutes misconduct, for which the consequences are suspension or termination of employment. To conduct a legal strike, 51 percent of a union’s membership must vote in favor in a secret ballot, and unions are required to give 30 days’ notice before striking. If the union is unregistered, does not have majority support, or calls a strike prior to issuing 30 days’ notice, the strike is considered illegal. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining were generally respected. Although the government restricted strikes in essential services, workers in hospitals, education services, and the transportation sector occasionally called strikes during the year and did not face any legal penalties. Many unions had links to political parties and did not operate independently from them but worked effectively to advance the rights of workers. The government did not interfere in the functioning of workers’ organizations or threaten union leaders. The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor and provides penalties which if enforced would be sufficient to deter violations. The law does not criminalize the recruitment, transportation, harboring, or receipt of persons by force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of forced labor. The government did not effectively enforce the law and the country continued to be a source, transit, and destination for men, women, and children who were subjected to forced labor. Government enforcement of the laws against bonded labor was uneven, and social reintegration of victims remained difficult. Resources, inspections, and remediation were inadequate, and penalties for violations were insufficient to deter violations. The government did not effectively screen for labor trafficking among abused migrant workers and handled such cases administratively in lieu of criminal investigation. In addition, despite reports of worker exploitation, including trafficking, and illegal recruitment fees charged by recruitment agencies, the government did not sufficiently investigate agencies for violations. Also see the Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/. The law establishes 15 as the minimum age for work and 17 as the minimum age for hazardous work, and it defines and mandates acceptable working conditions for children. The minimum age for hazardous work is not consistent with international standards because it does not prohibit children age 17 from engaging in hazardous work. The types of hazardous work prohibited for children also do not include brickmaking, a sector in which there is evidence that work involves carrying heavy loads and being exposed to hazardous substances. Employers must maintain separate records of laborers between the ages of 14 and 17. The law prohibits employment of children in factories, mines, and 60 other categories of hazardous work and limits children between the ages of 16 and 17 to a 36-hour workweek (six hours a day between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., six days a week). The law also establishes penalties for those who unlawfully employ children which are sufficient to deter violations. The Department of Labor, which is responsible for enforcing child labor laws and practices, did not effectively do so. The Department of Labor conducted most of its labor inspections in the formal sector while nearly all child labor occurred in the informal sector. The Department had 10 factory inspector positions in district labor offices and two senior factory inspector positions in Kathmandu. Chronic vacancies in these positions, however, limited the department’s effectiveness. Some of these positions were vacant due to regular rotation of civil servants, and resources devoted to enforcement were limited. Although labor inspectors periodically received training on child labor laws and inspection, this training did not necessarily adhere to any formal schedule. A broad range of laws and policies were designed to combat and eventually eliminate child labor. Penalties are sufficient to deter violations. Child labor, including forced child labor, occurred in agriculture, domestic service, portering, recycling, and transportation; the worst abuses were reported in brick kilns, the stone-breaking industry, the carpet sector, embroidery factories, and the entertainment sector. In the informal sector, children worked long hours in unhealthy environments, carried heavy loads, were at risk of sexual exploitation, and at times suffered from numerous health problems (see section 6, Children). Also see the Department of Labor’s Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings. The constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race, sex, caste, tribe, geographical or social origin, language, marital status, physical or health condition, disability, or ideological conviction. Labor regulations prohibit discrimination in payment or remuneration based on gender. There are no provisions in the constitution, law, or regulations prohibiting discrimination, including labor discrimination, or discrimination based on color, age, national origin or citizenship, HIV-positive status, or other communicable disease. Despite constitutional and legal protections, discrimination in employment and occupation occurred with respect to gender, caste, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, disability, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity, and HIV-positive status. Such discrimination was most common in the informal sector, where monitoring by the government and human rights organizations was weak or absent and those in disadvantaged categories had little leverage or recourse. In the formal sector, labor discrimination generally took the form of upper-caste men without disabilities being favored in hiring, promotions, and transfers. To be eligible for government jobs, Nepali national origin or citizenship is mandatory. According to the Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens and disability rights advocates, the overall rate of employment of persons with disabilities did not increase significantly. In the private sector, large numbers of persons with disabilities claimed they were denied work opportunities or dismissed due to their conditions. In all sectors employees with disabilities reported other forms of discriminatory treatment. According to the Nepal National Dalit Social Welfare Organization, the government made little progress in implementing antidiscrimination legal provisions to assure employment opportunities for lower-caste individuals in both the public and private sectors. There was no comprehensive data on this abuse. Reliable data on discrimination against LGBTI persons in various sectors was not available, but activists reported it was common for gender and sexual minorities to be denied promotions and competitive opportunities within the security services and athletics. The minimum wage exceeded the official poverty line but it was minimally sufficient to meet subsistence needs. Minimum-wage laws apply to both the formal sector (which accounted for approximately 10 percent of the workforce) and the informal sector, but implementation was stronger in the formal sector. The law stipulates a 48-hour workweek, with one day off per week and one-half hour of rest per five hours worked. The law limits overtime to no more than four hours in a day and 20 hours per week, with a 50 percent overtime premium per hour. Excessive compulsory overtime is prohibited. Employees are also entitled to paid public holiday leave, sick leave, annual leave, maternity leave, bereavement leave, and other special leave. The law provides adequate occupational health and safety standards and establishes other benefits, such as a provident fund, housing facilities, day-care arrangements for establishments with more than 50 female workers, and maternity benefits. The Ministry of Labor, and Employment, and Social Security reported that most factories in the formal sector complied with laws on minimum wage and hours of work, but implementation varied in the informal sector, including in agriculture and domestic servitude. The ministry did not employ a sufficient number of inspectors to enforce the wage and hour laws or the occupational health and safety laws. The government did not effectively enforce the law. Implementation and enforcement of occupational health and safety standards were minimal, and the Ministry of Labor, and Employment, and Social Security considered it the most neglected area of labor law enforcement. The ministry found violations across sectors, including in construction, mining, transportation, agriculture, and factory work. The government has not created the necessary regulatory or administrative structures to enforce occupational safety and health provisions. The Ministry of Labor, and Employment, and Social Security did not have a specific office dedicated to occupational safety and health, nor did it have inspectors specifically trained in this area. Penalties were insufficient to deter violations. Although the law authorizes factory inspectors to order employers to rectify unsafe conditions, enforcement of safety standards remained minimal, and monitoring was weak. Accurate data on workplace fatalities and accidents was not available. Labor law and regulations do not specify that workers can remove themselves from situations that endanger health or safety without jeopardizing their employment. The government regulated labor contracting, or “manpower,” agencies recruiting workers for overseas jobs, and penalized fraudulent recruitment practices. The government said it remained committed to the free-visa, free-ticket scheme introduced in 2015, but according to migrant rights NGOs, the government has failed to implement the policy effectively. Some government officials were complicit in falsifying travel documents and overlooking recruiting violations by labor contractors. The Department of Foreign Employment introduced measures during the year to reduce the number of registered manpower agencies and more closely scrutinize their activities. The myriad unregistered and unregulated labor “brokers” and intermediaries, who were often trusted members of the community, complicated effective monitoring of recruitment practices. Workers were also encouraged to register and pay a fee to the Foreign Employment Board, which tracked migrant workers and provided some compensation for workers whose rights were violated. The government required contracts for workers going abroad to be translated into Nepali and instituted provisions whereby workers must attend a predeparture orientation program. During the orientation workers are made aware of their rights and legal recourse, should their rights be violated. The effectiveness of the initiatives remained questionable since workers who went overseas often skipped the mandatory training, and many companies issued predeparture orientation certificates for a small fee and failed to deliver the training. Migrant workers heading abroad often continued to face exploitive conditions. According to the International Labor Organization, more than 70 percent of the economically active population was involved in the informal economy. The law provides for protection of workers from work situations that endanger their health and safety, but in small and cottage industries located in small towns and villages, employers sometimes forced workers to work in such situations or risk losing their jobs. The number of labor inspectors is insufficient for the size of the country’s workforce.

2704,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/26th-amendment-texas-absentee-ballots.html,Texas 26th amendment lawsuit: seven states restrict mail-in voting through unconstitutional age discrimination.,"Slate's Who Counts? series is made possible by the support of Slate Plus members and readers like you. The 26th Amendment is often viewed as a relic of the Vietnam War era, when 18-year-olds protested the fact that they were old enough to be drafted but not to cast a ballot. Ratified in less than 100 days, the amendment enshrined in the Constitution citizens’ right to vote at age 18, knocking down laws that set the voting age at 21. For decades, that guarantee was rarely invoked in court since lawmakers generally honored it. But as today’s voting rights foes exploit a pandemic to disenfranchise Americans, the amendment has newfound importance: It should prevent states from discriminating against younger voters with both subtle and brazen tactics. The threat of the coronavirus is creating unprecedented demand for absentee ballots; many Republican lawmakers are responding by trying to limit access. There are laws on the books to help them in one regard. Currently, seven states permit only elderly voters to mail in their ballots: Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas grant this privilege to voters 65 and older; Tennessee extends it to those 60 and older; and Kentucky only bestows it upon voters of “advance age.” (None of these states have waived their age limit for the November election, though Indiana and Kentucky did so for their primaries.) Younger people who want to vote by mail must give a reason, such as a serious illness or absence from the state on Election Day. As New York magazine’s Ed Kilgore has noted, these laws effectively limit absentee voting to “Trump-approved groups,” older Americans who are much more likely to vote Republican. On Wednesday, voting rights advocates filed a federal lawsuit against Texas’ restriction. It is likely the first in a spate of challenges to protect the election. Unless the federal judiciary decides to unilaterally rewrite the 26th Amendment, it will be obligated to invalidate these laws. Although it is often viewed as a simple promise that Americans can vote upon turning 18, the 26th Amendment is actually a broad ban on age-based voting restrictions. It declares that the right to vote “shall not be denied or abridged” for citizens 18 and over “on account of age.” In other words, the amendment does not just protect 18-year-olds’ ability to vote. It also forbids any law that abridges adult citizens’ right to vote because of their age. The amendment established a policy against laws that burden an adult’s suffrage due to their youth, reflecting a national consensus that younger adults deserve fully equal access to the ballot. As Yael Bromberg detailed in her groundbreaking study of the 26th Amendment, Congress said as much when considering the amendment in 1971: The Senate expressed its desire to remove “special burdens” on “young voters,” while the House of Representatives sought to abolish any voting law that had “the purpose or effect of discriminating on account of age.” Initially, courts adopted this view of the amendment. For instance, when striking down a policy that disenfranchised students living on campus, the New Jersey Supreme Court wrote in 1972 that the amendment “clearly evidences the purpose not only of extending the voting right to young voters but also of encouraging their participation by the elimination of all unnecessary burdens and barriers.” And the U.S. Supreme Court’s only 26th Amendment decision, Symm v. United States, struck down a county policy that singled out college students for special scrutiny when they registered to vote, forcing them to reveal personal information that ostensibly helped the registrar determine whether they qualified. Other courts invalidated similar laws that made it more difficult for college students to vote, even when they did not fully disenfranchise them. It is impossible to reconcile these decisions with contemporary laws that forbid adults of a certain age from voting by mail. In fact, it is remarkable that such laws remain on the books nearly a half-century after the ratification of the 26th Amendment. Today, most litigation over the amendment involves overt efforts to suppress college students’ suffrage—as when Florida attempted to outlaw early-voting sites on university campuses. (A federal judge blocked the rule as an unconstitutional age-based voting discrimination.) But the Constitution provides no lesser protection to voters age 18–64 who wish to vote absentee. As voting rights expert Joshua A. Douglas told me on Wednesday: “This is a strong claim. The 26th Amendment not only forbids states from denying the right to vote on the basis of age over 18. It also prohibits them from ‘abridging’ the right to vote based on age. Yet the Texas law does exactly that: impose discriminatory voting rules on the basis of age.” If Americans cannot vote by mail in November, they will be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional rights. Some advocates are fighting in state court to expand absentee balloting, citing the health crisis and state-level voting protections. But they face a fierce battle in states like Texas, where lawmakers are appealing a state court order that would let voters cite the coronavirus as an excuse to vote by mail. Luckily, in seven states—including Texas—the 26th Amendment plainly compels federal courts to strike the age limitation and open up vote by mail to everyone, young and old. Federal courts stacked with Donald Trump appointees may disagree given their flagrant disregard for precedent, but the Supreme Court should not let them write the amendment out of the Constitution. States simply have no power to impose “special burdens” on voters who are not in the demographic most favorable to Trump. Slate is making its coronavirus coverage free for all readers.

2707,https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200403/p2a/00m/0na/021000c,Japan's exclusion of adult entertainment workers from public aid blasted as discrimination - The Mainichi,"Please view the main text area of the page by skipping the main menu. The page may not be displayed properly if the JavaScript is deactivated on your browser. Japan's National Daily Since 1922 April 3, 2020 (Mainichi Japan) Japanese version TOKYO -- The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has excluded those working in the adult entertainment industry from its leave compensation program for those taking time off of work to care for their children due to nationwide closures of schools in response to the new coronavirus, a move that has drawn criticism for occupational discrimination. The labor ministry has explained that it determined that the industry type -- which includes nightclubs and other establishments that entail entertainment and sex work -- as ""unworthy of receiving public funds."" But on Twitter and elsewhere, people have protested, saying that ""withholding assistance to people engaging in a specific type of work when this is a matter of life or death is discrimination."" The ministry's program compensates companies up to 8,330 yen per person per day for employees who are taking paid leave to care for their children who attend day care centers and elementary or special education schools. In addition, freelancers who meet certain criteria are also eligible to receive 4,100 yen per person per day if they need to take time off from work to care for their children due to the school shutdowns. According to the ministry, those involved in the entertainment, restaurant and sex industries, alongside organized crime group members and organizations that have carried out or potentially will carry out terroristic and destructive activities, are ineligible for the public assistance. People have taken to Twitter and other platforms to criticize the ministry's policy, making such comments as, ""This is outright discrimination,"" and ""There are a lot of single mothers who work in the adult entertainment and sex industries to earn a living. They need assistance."" SWASH, an organization comprising people working in the sex industry and their supporters, submitted a request to the labor ministry on April 2, asking that the criteria for receiving assistance be reconsidered, saying that ""the right to life of all parents and children should be protected,"" and that ""discrimination against people working in the sex industry will be furthered by (making people in the sex industry ineligible for assistance)."" A labor ministry official said, ""Not just with this particular assistance program, but with all subsidy programs regarding employment, people in these types of occupations are ineligible. We determined that it would be inappropriate to use public funds to subsidize even business operators who have obtained legal permission under the Act on Control and Improvement of Amusement Business, etc."" In Tokyo, where the novel coronavirus has spread, Gov. Yuriko Koike has said, ""There are many cases in which it is speculated that people have contracted the virus at establishments operating at nighttime,"" and has called on patrons to refrain from going to such establishments. At the same time, she has said that she would be asking the central government to provide assistance to operators and staff of establishments that would be impacted by the request, and that the Tokyo Metropolitan Government would also be considering its own measures. The Part-Timer, Arbeiter, Freeter & Foreign Worker Union, of which the Cabakura Union -- for those in the adult entertainment and sex industry -- is a member, has released a statement seeking compensation from the government, saying, ""Particularly in the service industry and among nighttime occupations, the slump in business will become even harsher. Without any compensation or benefits, all we can do is to wait for our lives to collapse."" At a press conference on April 3, labor minister Katsunobu Kato suggested that he has no intention to review the current arrangement.

2713,https://www.theroot.com/africans-in-china-say-police-have-told-them-to-stop-sha-1843179562,Africans in China Say Police Have Told Them to Stop Sharing Stories About Racial Discrimination: Report,"A Ugandan woman who filmed a racist encounter at a Guangdong, China 7-Eleven earlier this month says Chinese police officers visited her shortly afterward demanding she delete the video. As BuzzFeed reports, Darasa (who wasn’t identified by her full name to protect her from possible retribution) is one of multiple Africans currently living in China who spoke to the outlet about their experiences being visited by the police after sharing videos of racist, xenophobic harassment and abuse. Anti-African discrimination and harassment made international news earlier in April after the country experienced a resurgence in coronavirus infections. China, where the novel coronavirus was first discovered, had curbed its coronavirus cases after hitting a peak in February; officials said the new outbreaks came from foreign travelers arriving from foreign countries. China had also recently relaxed travel restrictions within the country. Though it hasn’t been reported which country or countries the outbreak stemmed from, African migrants became scapegoats among some Chinese residents and businesses. The most well-known case of discrimination thus far came from a Guangzhou McDonalds, which posted a sign explicitly stating “black people are not allowed to the restaurant.” The resulting backlash has Chinese immigration police actively trying to contain videos and other documentation of racist treatment from getting out, BuzzFeed’s sources tell them. Darasa told the outlet that after filming and posting an encounter at 7-Eleven where staff members refused her entry and sprayed disinfectant at her feet, two groups of police officers came to her hotel to pay her visit. They demanded she delete the video. One group of four officers brought her a “gift” box which included hand sanitizer, a face mask, and tea bags as part of an effort to get her to cooperate with authorities, she said. “We’re in their country, so they can still do whatever they wish to us,” said Darasa. Others reported similar experiences. One person’s story suggests that Chinese authorities are even infiltrating black WhatsApp groups. From BuzzFeed: A Ugandan known as Omuntu Wawansi, who lives outside Shanghai, secretly recorded his interrogation by immigration police last week after helping several Africans facing discrimination in China connect with foreign news outlets. After Wawansi shared the video with the foreigners’ WhatsApp group, he was surprised to get a call from the same police officer he caught on tape. “We’re like pets to them — you’re supposed to just stay in their lane,” Wawansi said. “You’re not supposed to speak up if you’re violated in any way.” The high-level concern about limiting stories of racist incidents stems from the government’s desire to “preserve economic and diplomatic ties [it] had spent years building with African nations,” writes BuzzFeed. Though, of course, it’s worth questioning what Chinese authorities have done to stop the racist incidents from happening in the first place, rather than mitigating the spread of the stories themselves. The impulse to punish Africans for the spread of the virus is both xenophobic and racist, not unlike the spike in hate crimes and harassment against Asians and Asian Americans in the U.S. after the coronavirus spread in this country. Officials recently reported that most of the first wave of coronavirus cases in New York City, now the global epicenter of the crisis, actually came from Europe. Still, in the U.S. and in China, white people have not been targeted or blamed for spreading the virus. And in China specifically, the anti-blackness directed at African migrants is made all the more concerning because of the state’s capacity for monitoring and policing its residents. Unfortunately, those who do want to return to their home countries, like Darasa, cannot. In an attempt to ease the suffering of some of the African students and workers living in China, Atlanta Black Star CEO Neil Nelson has tried to work with Ugandan politicians to try to organize an airlift for those who want to leave. The demand is certainly there—300 people have asked for seats on such an evacuation flight, Nelson told BuzzFeed. But thus far, in part because of prohibitive costs and travel restrictions, no African country has been willing or able to receive them. There are estimated 1 million Chinese in Africa. So it’s only fair that a million Africans can live in and visit China. 1.2 billion in Africa and 1.3 billion in China. The future is African and Asian. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa%E2%80%93China_relations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africans_in_Guangzhou",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2814,https://time.com/5820389/africans-guangzhou-china-coronavirus-discrimination/,Africans in Guangzhou Say They Are Targets of Discrimination Over Coronavirus,"Jay has been locked in his apartment in the southern Chinese megacity of Guangzhou since April 9—when a doctor, local official and a translator delivered a mandatory quarantine order due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The order came despite the fact that he hasn’t traveled in three months, is showing no symptoms of the disease and hasn’t come into contact with anyone who has tested positive. The English teacher, who comes from South Africa, checks his temperature every day and sends the readings to his landlord. A camera installed in the hallway of his building points straight at his door to make sure he doesn’t leave. “When I asked my landlord why me specifically, she said, ‘That’s what the government wanted. All Africans must be isolated at home,’” says Jay, who asked to go by a pseudonym because of fears he could be deported. It’s just one way that Jay and other African immigrants say they have been discriminated against by local authorities after a spike in imported COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou. Six Africans in Guangzhou who spoke to TIME say they were placed under quarantine, despite no recent travel history or other risk factors. Some had magnetic strips and alarms installed on their doors to deter them from leaving. Ms. A., a Ugandan woman who asked to be identified only by an initial for fear of reprisals at her workplace, says she and her four Ugandan roommates were taken to a hotel to quarantine, where they were charged almost $500 each. “The quarantine is OK if they’re doing the right thing,” she says. “But this is discrimination.” Widely shared videos online appear to show Africans being barred from entering some supermarkets and restaurants. In one video filmed at a McDonald’s, a worker holds a sign that states black people cannot enter. (The company later apologized).’ Read more: South African President Cyril Ramaphosa: How Countries in Africa Are Working Together to Fight Coronavirus The U.S. State Department has weighed in, as well, issuing an alert Saturday advising African-Americans to avoid travel to Guangzhou over concern they could be targeted for quarantine by local officials. According to the statement, some local businesses had refused service to African-Americans.  The rise in reported discrimination comes after China’s own condemnation of racist attacks on ethnically Chinese people around the world as the coronavirus has spread. It also follows Beijing’s attempts to stave off a second wave of infections after beating back the original outbreak, even reopening Wuhan, the city where the outbreak was first reported, on April 8. The majority of officially reported cases in China are now imported, mostly from Chinese nationals returning home after all foreign nationals were banned from entry in late March. Guangzhou, a commercial and manufacturing hub of 13 million formerly known as Canton during colonial times, is home to one of Asia’s largest populations of Africans—many of them traders involved in buying cheap electronics and clothing to sell back home. At least 15,000 nationals from Africa live in the city, according to official figures. But researchers say thousands more are believed to be there illegally. Racial tensions have occasionally flared in the city, though Guangzhou’s African community is generally well-assimilated. However, many Africans say they are facing a surge of hostility and following rumors on social media that they were spreading the coronavirus. Keep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter. Gordon Mathews, an anthropology professor at Chinese University of Hong Kong who has spent time with African communities in Guangzhou, says Africans in the city face discrimination on a day-to-day basis. He says he has found that even those who have lived in Guangzhou for years have little attachment to the city. “They very rarely see Guangzhou as a second home,” Mathews says. “As I’m told, it’s a good place to make a living, but not to make a life.” The reports of tightened surveillance of Africans seemed to begin after a news story about a Nigerian man allegedly biting a nurse who tried to stop him from leaving a local hospital. The story was widely shared on the Chinese social media site Weibo and drew a slew of xenophobic comments, including that “Guangzhou has been colonized by Africans.” Read more: Few Doctors, Fewer Ventilators: African Countries Fear They Are Defenseless Against Inevitable Spread of Coronavirus Local health officials said Monday that 4,500 Africans were tested for coronavirus since April 4, and 111 were confirmed positive. As of Wednesday, there were 494 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Guangzhou, according to the Guangdong Health Commission. Guangzhou Mayor Wen Guohui said in a press conference on Sunday that “foreigners will not be discriminated against in the fight against COVID-19.”Some local residents are leading efforts to support the African community. In a private group on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, some 250 members translate official documents and news reports to help African residents. They also coordinate food donations and deliver them, and have collected a list of hotels that will accept Africans. And on the Twitter-like microblogging platform Weibo, some have left comments defending Africans and condemning racist behavior. “Discrimination is a display of stupidity and ignorance,” one said. Another comment read: “China absolutely has a group of people with a serious problem of discrimination. [I] feel embarrassed.” The reports coming out of Guangzhou are causing diplomatic problems for China. Nigeria, Uganda and Ghana are among the countries that have summoned their Chinese ambassadors to protest the reported discrimination. The African Union Commission, which represents 55 member states, has expressed “extreme concern at allegations of maltreatment of Africans” in Guangzhou. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that authorities in Guangdong would be “improving measures” and will “gradually lift health management [restrictions] over African nationals.” The ministry added that the measures were based on “a principle of no discrimination.” Some Africans say the renewed racial tensions have made them realize that living in Guangzhou may no longer be tenable, even after this coronavirus spike passes. “I don’t think people are going to start liking you and being friendly with you as soon as the quarantine is done,” Jay says. He acknowledges that there’s always been an air of discrimination, but now “things have changed.” He is due to renew his teaching contract at the end of the year, but says that he’s already planning not to. “I’ve seen how wildly the xenophobia has sort of pushed across Guangzhou,” he says. But not everyone can pack up and go—many are reliant on the opportunities in Guangzhou to sustain their families back home. Tanzo, who asked to go by her nickname, comes to Guangzhou three times a year. The 37-year-old trader from Uganda spends a month or two in the city each time, buying children’s shoes to send back home. Tanzo traveled to Guangzhou in late February, and went to a 7-Eleven near her hotel shortly after she arrived. When she reached to open the door, two workers inside waved their hands and shook their heads. One ran to the door and locked it. Tanzo got the message and stepped back—the workers then unlocked it and sprayed down the door, the door handle, and the area where Tanzo had stood. Other stores she tried also told her she was not allowed to go inside. She went back to her hotel empty-handed. Stunned, she called her Ugandan friend who lives in the city. “I asked her, ‘What’s happening in Guangzhou? They’re treating me like I’m the one who brought the illness!” Tanzo said. “My friend told me, ‘That’s how they do us now.'” Please send tips, leads, and stories from the frontlines to virus@time.com.

2909,http://www.blackagendareport.com/expect-police-military-repression-amid-crisis-covid-19-and-its-aftermath,Expect Police-Military Repression Amid the Crisis of COVID-19 and Its Aftermath | Black Agenda Report,"The rulers are concerned about the class war becoming sharper in the current crisis and they are preparing to send in the military and police to quell dissent. “The pre-existing crisis of legitimacy for the rulers is compounded by the government’s inept response to the pandemic.” News stories about the National Guard assisting with the coronavirus have overshadowed stories about US military plans to join police in stopping expected “civil disturbances.” But eyewitness accounts of trains transporting armored vehicles and other equipment into their communities prompted posts to social media about the threat of martial law. The Department of Defense responded with a media defensive to dismiss the concerns as conspiracy theories, sticking to the strict definition of martial law. They assure that the duties of the reserve National Guard personnel are only for things like disinfecting public spaces, delivering food to homes, and erecting provisional medical facilities. Semantic games and a neglect to connect the dots are meant to assuage public concerns. Martial law is the imposition of direct and temporary military control of normal civilian functions -- although to argue whether or not military involvement means direct control is to split hairs. The outcomes are the same for Black and First Nations working class people in the US settler colonial state. Those communities live under constant police-state control designed to maintain the Pan-European white supremacist colonial/capitalist patriarchy. The only “normal” civilian functions for them are to serve the industrial metropole. Otherwise, to neoliberal capitalists they are a surplus population. “Black and First Nations working class people live under constant police-state control.” In December prior to the pandemic Attorney General William Barr launched Operation Relentless Pursuit, a “surge” in seven US cities of federal agents, more enforcement funding, police department access to more equipment, and an ability to hire more police. This is another operation meant to deal with the surplus population. When Chief of the National Guard Bureau, Gen. Joseph L. Lengyel’s adds the caveat that “the Guard has legal authorities to participate in law enforcement operations, such as crowd control but usually does so under the supervision of local police,” he offers a distinction without a difference. The rulers are concerned about the class war becoming sharper in the current crisis and they are preparing to send in the military and police to quell dissent. A Washington Post piece warns of “a much larger, and more fraught, role for the armed forces in this crisis: They might need to backstop and backfill police forces…” Shortages of police may mean the military is needed for “…major assistance with patrolling streets, enforcing restrictions on movement, deterring crime and other tasks […which…] might be the most prudent thing we can do to reduce the risk of deteriorating social stability and security,” say the authors of the article. “Shortages of police may mean the military is needed for major assistance with patrolling streets.” The treatment for entitled white teenagers refusing to stay home and off beaches will not be the same as the mistreatment of Black and Brown communities expressing their frustrations with second class citizenship. Mounting dissatisfactions with the system are obvious in the wildcat strikes of workers demanding hazard pay and personal protective equipment (PPE) to safely perform their jobs during the pandemic. Economists are also forecasting that an alarming 47 million jobs will be lost leading to 32% unemployment, the highest figure since the great depression. The pre-existing crisis of legitimacy for the rulers is compounded by the government’s inept response to the pandemic and the private sector’s shameless efforts to profit from the people’s suffering. The 1968 Kerner Commission Report on civil disturbances warned of what happens when the oppressed have had enough. The impasse, however, is at the solutions. Free healthcare for anyone sick, housing as a human right, and relief money from the government all go against capitalism and are therefore not meant to last. Society is approaching an ultimate clash between classes that presents the oppressors with essentially two contrasting responses. People rebelling because they are hungry could be brutally suppressed, or could be given food and democratic control over the production and distribution of food. US white supremacist colonial/capitalist patriarchy tends respond to such crises with the former option. “Forty-seven million jobs will be lost leading to 32% unemployment.” Fatalities have always been the result of the police-military mix in response to major unrest in the US: In 2005 in the scramble to survive Hurricane Katrina, 1992 in response to verdicts in police beating of Rodney King, and 1968 after the assassination of Dr. King. And Black people always get the worst of these crackdowns. The Washington Post article suggesting the USA, “should prepare now to send US armed forces to help police…” concludes in point one-of-four that “Police departments should make plans for apprentice-like training of Guard personnel who probably know a lot about how to wear body armor, operate weapons, maintain discipline, use communications systems and work long hours — but who probably know much less about easing tense civic situations, handling suspects while presuming innocence and securing evidence.” The assumption that police are adept in easing tense civic situations, etc would be laughable if it weren’t insulting. All armed forces of the US state –whether police, National Guard, active duty military -- serve the same essential purpose, to protect the settler colonial and imperialist paradigm. The distinction between them is like that between the FBI and CIA; one enforces domestic domination and the other foreign. When the government turns to the military for the economic symptoms of the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath, poor Black and Brown people will be met in city streets by armed troops trained to occupy hostile foreign territory and primed with the racist and classist attitudes inherent in the police.

3237,https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/news/2020/4/press-release-royal-parks-faces-landmark-legal-challenge-alleging-indirect-race-discrimination-against-bame-outsourced-cleaners,PRESS RELEASE: Royal Parks faces landmark legal challenge alleging indirect race discrimination against BAME outsourced cleaners,"Search  En Español < News 14.04.2020 / News / Press releases / Royal Parks For immediate release 14 April 2020 Royal Parks faces landmark legal challenge alleging indirect race discrimination against BME outsourced cleaners 3.3 million workers to be affected by landmark legal challenge brought against the Royal Parks, the charity tasked with administering the Queen’s London Parks The cleaners have made a claim of indirect race discrimination under the Equality Act 2010 Trade union United Voices of the World (UVW) claims the ruling will set a precedent to be used against other employers The Royal Parks, a charity set up by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and tasked with the administration of the Queen’s London parks, has today found itself accused of indirect race discrimination and subject to legal challenge. Late yesterday evening, trade union, United Voices of the World (UVW), filed a challenge with the Central London Employment Tribunal. Represented by leading discrimination barrister Changez Khan of Farrar’s Building, the challenge contends that the outsourcing of their cleaners and toilet attendants, who are overwhelmingly black African migrant workers, onto minimum terms and conditions, whilst conferring generous conditions and benefits on their 90% white inhouse staff, amounts to indirect racial discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. Trade union officials have described the case as a ‘landmark legal challenge’ affecting 3.3 million outsourced workers across the UK. Contending that for the challenge to succeed it will simply be sufficient to show the effects of outsourcing – irrespective of the conscious intentions of the Royal Parks – results in workers with protected characteristics being subject to a double standard of treatment with respect to minimum levels of contractual benefits. UVW has as members the majority of the outsourced cleaners and toilet attendants working across the eight Royal Parks, who are almost all black migrants from African countries such as Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Richard O’Keeffe, Head of Legal Services at United Voices of the World (UVW), said the following: ‘This is a test case. We are asking the courts to consider for the first time whether a double standard as to what is an appropriate minimum rate of pay, sick and maternity pay provision and pension contributions as between 90% white in-house staff and 90% black outsourced contract workers is justified by the purported efficiencies and cost savings that outsourcing is said to effect. That question will be fact sensitive, but if in principal this type of outsourcing arrangement requires justification to be Equality Act compliant, it will force employers to think more carefully before they operate a two-tier system which disadvantages migrant labour’. One Park Attendant, who wished to remain anonymous, said the following: ‘We’ve been treated like dirt by VINCI and them [The Royal Parks]. We never get paid properly, and what we do get paid is really far below the other workers. This isn’t fair. We’ve had enough’.

3242,http://www.adiosbarbie.com/2020/04/the-weight-of-words-how-the-term-obesity-is-weaponized-to-excuse-discrimination/,The Weight of Words: How the Term “Obesity” is Weaponized to Excuse Discrimination - Adios Barbie,"By Jori Hamilton We’ve all read the hysterical headlines warning us of the “growing threat” of the “obesity epidemic.” We’ve all seen the hyperbolic ads for fad diets such as Code Red or even intermittent fasting and miracle products splashed across social media, promising to end the scourge of “obesity-related diseases.” People are even claiming that those with higher BMI’s are at special risk of dying from the coronavirus. “Obesity” has become the buzzword for everything in modern society that is bad, dangerous, or repugnant about our bodies. In fact, studies show that women perceived to be “overweight” or “obese” are more likely to face felony conviction in a jury trial than are leaner defendants, both male and female. But what are the meanings — the intentions — behind the words? And what are the effects, especially now that “obesity” has been transformed into a diagnosis? Is obesity truly a pathology, or is it simply a means to excuse discrimination, to conceal prejudice behind a medical label and, in the process, to legitimize such prejudice? It’s time to take a long, hard look at the way terms like “obesity” are bandied about in our society, because words matter. They are the truly weighty things because they shape not only our discourse but our thoughts. They inform what we believe and how we feel. Even more importantly, they exert their greatest influence at the subconscious level, shaping our values in ways we rarely understand or even recognize. Consider the recent Washington Post essay written by an emergency room physician in which the author describes his patient as “a mountain of flesh” and blithely describes the judgmental and often cruel remarks of the patient’s supposedly “compassionate caregivers.” It is as if such scornful remarks were the only natural response to a man of the patient’s size. But the language used to describe the patient isn’t just vicious and shaming. It’s also profoundly dehumanizing. The patient is no longer a thinking, feeling human being, a man sick, in pain, and in need of care. No, the man is pathologically “obese.” The man is his diagnosis, his disease, and with this diagnosis comes a host of profoundly negative connotations, invoking a shocking pattern of assumptions that shape not only how the patient is perceived, but how he is treated. Look again at the way the treating physician describes his hurting patient. He is, according to the doctor, a middle-aged man who spends his days on his sofa, drawing “disability checks” for back pain. In other words, he’s not only “lazy,” but a mooch. A drain on society’s resources. A vampire sucking away the care and help that other, worthier, people need. Basically, if he’s sick and in pain, he deserves it. Not only is this fatphobic, it’s ableist and classist. In a vicious circle of discrimination, the patient is being devalued because he is obese. He is obese because he is in pain. He is in pain because he cannot afford care. He cannot afford care because he cannot work. He cannot work because he is obese — and so on. As powerful as the term “obesity” has become in our society, the simple fact is it has no basis in empirical, biological reality. There are no definitive boundary lines to objectively differentiate between the lean, the overweight, and the obese. This can be seen in how airlines create policies to define who is obese and who is not when requiring people to buy extra seats for flights. Which definition of obese should be used to require someone to purchase more airplane real estate? Is there one? In 2015, Samoa Air announced it would start charging its passengers by weight. As airplane seat space shrinks, policies continually change. Furthermore, during the current Covid-19 pandemic, misinformation spreads easily and quickly. Some have even said that obesity can make people more susceptible to the virus, which is clearly false. Although obesity can cause complications to the recovery process, these complications are present in any situation and have nothing to do with Covid-19, specifically. This misinformation only fuels the fire of obesity discrimination. Above all, there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate a clear, causal link between an elevated BMI and the risk of so-called “obesity-related” diseases. The simple fact is, “obesity” is not a biological category. It is a moral and ideological one. It is used to separate the active, fit, healthy, and “hard-working” from the supposedly weak, self-indulgent, sick, and lazy. It’s used to separate society’s “good” and “worthy” people from its “bad” and “unworthy” ones. Once again, as exemplified by our patient from the Washington Post essay, he is seen as unworthy because he cannot “productively” contribute to our capitalist society. According to the essay writer, he takes from it in the form of his disability checks, reinforcing all the stereotypes of fatphobia, ableism, and classism. Yet morally, the US form of capitalism is set up to help people like him. How then, is it fair to call him unproductive in this capitalist society? The first responsibility of the healthcare provider is to provide just, equitable, comprehensive, and compassionate care to all those in need, no matter who they are. The principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence are the cornerstone of ethical medical practice. These principles instruct the caregiver to strive to their utmost to prevent suffering and protect the patient from harm, both physical and psychological. Unfortunately, the “obesity” paradigm is having the exact opposite effect. Studies show that patients clinically diagnosed as obese are far more likely to be denied proper medical care. Their symptoms are immediately — and without evidence — dismissed as being related to their size. The robust attention and viable treatment plans suffering patients deserve, and that are the physicians’ responsibility to provide, are denied in lieu of recommendations to lose weight, eat better, and exercise more. Thus, the blame for the illness and the burden of recovery is dropped squarely on the patients’ shoulders alone. The modern obsession with health, youth, and beauty is nothing new in our culture. For centuries, men and women have been chasing the eternal carrot of perfect health, while women, in particular, have labored under immense social pressure to conform to some largely unattainable ideal of the female body. In today’s society, however, the medicalization of the term “obesity” has increasingly come to serve as a weapon against those who do not meet the cultural ideal. The label has come to legitimize, perpetuate, and conceal discrimination under the guise of a medical “diagnosis.” It hides cruelty beneath the veil of kindness, and it misrepresents overt discrimination as a well-meaning form of “tough love.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3293,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/africa-armed-conflicts-and-state-repression-fuel-cocktail/,Africa: Armed conflicts and state repression fuel cocktail of human rights violations,"Protesters across sub-Saharan Africa have braved bullets and beatings to defend their rights in the face of continuing conflict and state repression, Amnesty International said today as it published its annual review of human rights in the region. The organization highlighted the bravery and defiance of people who took to the streets to demand change, but warned that they are being let down by governments who continue to perpetrate human rights violations across the region. The report analyzes major developments from the past year including the deposition of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, the Zimbabwean government’s response to mass protests, and increasing attacks on civilians in Mozambique and Mali. “In 2019 we saw incredible people power in mass protests which swept across sub-Saharan Africa. From Sudan to Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo to Guinea, people braved brutal crackdowns to stand up for their rights,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s East and Southern Africa Director. “In some cases, these protests led to major changes, following the toppling of Sudan’s long-time leader Omar al-Bashir the new authorities promised human rights friendly reforms and following protest a raft package of human rights reforms was introduced by the Ethiopian government. Sadly, other changes needed are being blocked by repressive governments, who continue to carry out violations with impunity.” Across sub-Saharan Africa civilians bore the brunt of deadly conflicts and violent crises. In Sudan’s Darfur region, government forces continued to commit possible war crimes and other serious human rights violations, including unlawful killings, sexual violence, systematic looting and forced displacement. In DRC, dozens of local and foreign armed groups together with the country’s security forces continued to carry out human rights abuses resulting in more than 2000 civilian deaths and at least 1 million were forcibly displaced in the course of 2019. In Somalia, civilians continued to live with attacks from the armed group Al-Shabaab, while government and allied international forces failed to take sufficient precautions to spare civilians from their attacks targeted at Al-Shabaab. Armed groups carried out attacks directed against civilians in Cameroon, Central African Republic and Burkina Faso, while governments failed to protect civilians. Security deteriorated significantly in the centre of Mali, with widespread killings of civilians by armed groups and self-proclaimed ‘self-defence groups’. In response, Malian security forces committed multiple violations including extrajudicial executions and torture. In Mozambique, armed groups continued to carry out attacks against the general population in Cabo Delgado, and security forces were alleged to have committed serious human rights violations in their response to the violence. In Ethiopia clashes between ethnic communities were met with a disproportionate response by security forces. In Cameroon’s Anglophone regions, armed separatist groups continued to commit abuses including killings, mutilations and abductions. Several healthcare facilities were also destroyed by armed separatists. In response the military committed extrajudicial executions and burned homes. “Access to healthcare remains a major concern for people across the region, with underfunded health budgets leading to shortages of beds and drugs in hospitals. Governments from Angola to Zimbabwe, Burundi to Cameroon have failed to respect the right to health, and conflicts have exacerbated the situation,” said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International’s West and Central Africa Regional Director. “With the COVID-19 pandemic looming, there is no time to waste in addressing the inequalities and human rights violations which make healthcare inaccessible for so many.”Violent state repression Across the region human rights defenders were persecuted and harassed for standing up and speaking out against governments. Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini, Zambia and Equatorial Guinea all saw surging crackdowns on activism in 2019. For example, in Malawi activists who organized and led demonstrations against alleged electoral fraud after the May elections were attacked and intimidated by ruling party youth cadres and targeted for prosecution by the authorities. The vote was later annulled by the courts and the country is preparing for another election later this year. In Zimbabwe, at least 22 human rights defenders, activists, civil society and opposition leaders were charged for their suspected role in organizing protests against the January 2019 fuel price hikes. Security forces unleashed a violent crackdown, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens of others. In Guinea where the authorities banned over 20 protests on vague and overly broad grounds, security forces continued to fuel violence during demonstrations and at least 17 people were killed last year. In 17 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, journalists were arbitrarily arrested and detained in 2019. In Nigeria for example, 19 cases of assault, arbitrary arrest, and detention of journalists were recorded, with many facing trumped up charges. In Burundi, authorities continued to crack down on the work of human rights defenders and civil society organizations including by subjecting them to prosecution and lengthy prison terms. Persistent human rights violations forced hundreds of thousands of people in the region to flee their homes in search of protection. There were about 600,000 internally displaced people in CAR; more than 222,000 people in Chad, and over half a million in Burkina Faso. In South Africa, deadly systematic xenophobic violence continued against refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, partly driven by years of impunity for past attacks and criminal justice failures. Twelve people, including South Africans and foreigners were killed after violence erupted between August and September. Despite the bleak background, some notable human rights wins emerged last year. Mass protests in Sudan brought an end to the repressive rule of Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 and the new authorities promised wide ranging reforms to improve enjoyment of human rights; and the Ethiopian government overturned the civil society legislation which had curtailed the right to freedoms of association and expression and introduced a new law before Parliament replacing draconian anti-terror legislation. In the DRC, authorities announced the release of 700 prisoners, including several prisoners of conscience. There were also victories for individuals. In Mauritania, blogger and prisoner of conscience Mohamed Mkhaïtir was released after more than five years in arbitrary detention. Although impunity for human rights violations largely continued, there were some small steps forward in 2019. There was a glimmer of hope for some of the families of victims of US airstrikes in Somalia when the US military Africa Command (AFRICOM) for the first time in April 2019 admitted killing two civilians in an airstrike in 2018, however neither US diplomatic staff nor AFRICOM had reached out to the family to offer reparation. There has also been some progress in CAR’s ordinary courts examining some cases of abuses by armed groups. The Special Criminal Court received 27 complaints and started investigations last year. “Activists and young people challenged the establishment in 2019. In 2020 leaders must listen to their demands and work towards urgently needed reforms that respect the rights of everyone,” said Samira Daoud.

The federal government has expressed shocked and disappointment over racial discrimination against Nigerians and other Africans living in China. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, expressed Nigerian government’s disappointment on Thursday, while fielding questions from journalists at the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 daily briefing in Abuja. Mr Onyeama said the federal government would pursue any case of discrimination made against any Nigerian in China to its logical end. He said the Nigerian government was disappointed with China that such racial discrimination could happen at this time. “We are deeply wounded by what is happening to Nigerians and other Africans living in China, it is something we never expected and we will pursue it,” he said. Mr Onyeama said irrespective of the economic ties and cooperation with China, Nigeria would not accept any racial discrimination against Nigeria and other blacks in China. He said Nigeria had been engaging with China Consular and the country’s Ambassador in Beijing. He said that every step would be taken to address the matter. The minister said Nigeria had made it known to China that on no account would she accept racial discrimination against its citizenry living in China. He said Nigeria was working with other African countries for a definite measure to take against China in such racial discrimination case. Mr Onyeama also said Nigerians abroad who sought to return to the country would soon be brought back and taken to isolation centres. He said the isolation centres had been prepared in Lagos and Abuja for Nigerians expected from abroad. (NAN) Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .

Ned Lamont’s top officials, Paul Mounds and Josh Geballe, announcing her resignation immediately at 5:45 p.m. She never returned to the Emergency Operation Center where she had been working that day. DPH spokesman Av Harris said there would be no comment on Roman’s claims of discrimination or anything relating to personnel matters. He said the department remains focused on the coronavirus pandemic. “Our response has been unaffected by her departure,” Harris said Wednesday. Lamont’s office declined to comment about the resignation. After Roman resigned, Geballe, who is the governor’s chief operating officer, immediately emailed Nicholas Hermes, the state’s human resources director, ordering him to ensure that DPH’s human resources team moved quickly ""on the separation.'' Roman, who is a registered nurse, was supposed to be the department’s liaison in the Emergency Operations Center and involved in all high-level meetings with Lamont, emergency management officials and other commissioners. On March 2 Roman spent the day with the U.S. Surgeon General, Vice Admiral Jerome Adams, when he toured the UConn Health Center and met with state officials, including Lamont, about their preparations for COVID-19. DPH Commissioner Renee Coleman-Mitchell also attended that meeting with the surgeon general, but Roman’s resignation letter makes it clear they didn’t have a good working relationship. “Working for Commissioner Coleman-Mitchell has been an incredible disappointment for me,"" Roman said without elaborating further. Coleman-Mitchell had appointed Roman the department’s COVID-19 czar in an email to the entire department weeks earlier, informing staff she would be heading up all of the department’s efforts to fight the virus, from staffing issues to equipment purchases. The Courant has tried several times to reach Roman for comment. On Wednesday her attorney, Irene Bassock, issued a statement on her behalf that she is considering legal action against the state. “Ms. Roman is weighing her options at this time, including whether to purse claims of illegal discrimination, harassment, and retaliation,” Bassock said. Even though she is the commissioner of the department at the center of the state’s response to the pandemic, Coleman-Mitchell hasn’t been a regular day presence at the governor’s daily coronavirus press conferences. At the last press conference in which she appeared, Coleman-Mitchell struggled to clearly explain a COVID-19 death at a Stafford nursing home. Instead, state epidemiologist Matthew Cartter has often been the face of the department during the coronavirus pandemic, attending numerous press conferences and answering questions. Geballe also has handled questions about DPH’s response, including announcing Tuesday that DPH had been giving out inaccurate numbers of COVID deaths because of miscommunication with the medical examiner’s office, which knew of 17 COVID-19 related deaths that DPH didn’t have in its records. Roman was named deputy commissioner in October. Her salary was $140,000 annually, according to state records.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3446,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-africa-idUKKCN21T0T5,African ambassadors complain to China over 'discrimination' in Guangzhou,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 4 Min Read JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - African ambassadors in China have written to the country’s foreign minister over what they call discrimination against Africans as the country seeks to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus. Several African countries have separately also demanded that China address their concerns that Africans, in particular in the southern city of Guangzhou, are being mistreated and harassed. Having brought under control the original outbreak centred on the city of Wuhan, China is now concerned about imported cases and is stepping up scrutiny of foreigners coming into the country and tightening border controls. It has denied any discrimination. In recent days Africans in Guangzhou have reported being ejected from their apartments by their landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results and being shunned and discriminated against in public. Such complaints have been made in local media, and on social media. The ambassadors’ note said such “stigmatisation and discrimination” created the false impression that the virus was being spread by Africans. “The Group of African Ambassadors in Beijing immediately demands the cessation of forceful testing, quarantine and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans,” it said. The note was sent to State Councilor Wang Yi, the Chinese government’s top diplomat, copying the chair of the African Union, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and all African foreign ministers. “The Guangdong authorities attach great importance to some African countries’ concerns and are working promptly to improve their working method,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a statement published Sunday, referring to the province in which Guangzhou is located. “African friends can count on getting fair, just, cordial and friendly reception in China,” he said, adding the foreign ministry will stay in close communication with Guangdong authorities and address the “African side’s reasonable concerns and legitimate appeals”. Zhao’s statement did not reference the ambassadors’ note to Wang and did not mention the allegations of discrimination against Africans in the city. Foreign affairs official Liu Baochun told a news conference separately on Sunday that Guangzhou is enforcing anti-virus measures on anyone who enters the city from across the national border, regardless of nationality, race or gender. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe on Saturday dismissed the accusation that Africans were being deliberately targeted. “It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents,” it said in a tweeted statement. “China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.” The ambassadors’ note highlighted a number of reported incidents, including that Africans were being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night, the seizure of passports, and threats of visa revocation, arrest or deportation. On Saturday, Ghana’s foreign minister of affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey said she had summoned the Chinese ambassador to express her disappointment and demand action. Kenya’s foreign ministry has also “officially expressed concern”, adding the government is working with Chinese authorities to address the matter. On Friday, Nigerian legislator Akinola Alabi tweeted a video of a meeting between the leader of Nigeria’s lower house of parliament, Femi Gbajabiamila, and Chinese Ambassador Zhou Pingjian. In it, Gbajabiamila demanded an explanation from the diplomat after showing Zhou a video of a Nigerian complaining about mistreatment in China. The ambassador said in response to the questions from the house leader that he took the complaints “very seriously” and promised to convey them to the authorities back home.

PAUL, MN-- Minnesota has launched a new discrimination hotline aimed at fighting racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Governor Tim Walz, the state has recently seen a rise in reports of discrimination toward the Asian American community. Walz said he hopes this new hotline will reinforce the Minnesota's efforts to protect civil rights. “Minnesotans are resilient people who support their neighbors when the going gets tough,” Governor Walz said. “As Asian Americans in Minnesota report heightened cases of discrimination amid COVID-19, my message is clear: Viruses don’t discriminate, and neither do we.” “There’s a distinct pattern in our nation’s history of increased discrimination during uncertain and trying times, of needing someone to blame,” Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan said. “This is unacceptable and, as Minnesotans, we must work to break this cycle.” The hotline is toll-free and will allow those who either experienced or witnessed any discrimination to report the incidents to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.

3536,https://www.nhregister.com/opinion/article/Opinion-Crisis-no-excuse-for-discrimination-15192437.php,Opinion: Crisis no excuse for discrimination,"West Haven City Hall Days after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, the mayor of Gretna, a neighboring town, deployed police officers to physically block their mostly African-American neighbors from crossing a bridge to escape the dire conditions in the city, actions that were widely condemned as immoral and racially motivated. Connecticut cannot afford such callousness and disregard for human decency in the current pandemic. But one town, West Haven, tried to take a page from that same playbook. Relying on stereotypes that people who are homeless are dangerous, city officials there attempted to use their police force to stop an effort that provides safe and secure housing for their neighbors currently living in dormitory-style New Haven shelters. Initially, West Haven upended the deal by requiring a hotel pay nearly $5,000 a day to have two uniformed police and a patrol car stationed at the hotel around the clock. It is only because of scrutiny in the press and the persistent efforts of the state of Connecticut and other advocates that this ploy did not succeed. That West Haven attempted to use its police power to create a financial barrier rather than a physical one makes it no less outrageous or real. Such actions are illegal. This is because state and federal civil rights laws prohibit discrimination based on race, national origin and disability. These laws prohibit imposing different terms and conditions to discourage or prevent people from living where they want based on stereotypes about them. People living in homeless shelters in New Haven often are, or are perceived to be, people with disabilities as well as disproportionately racial and ethnic groups who have long experienced hostility and discrimination. These are not lawful reasons to require a constant police presence where they live - something the town has never previously required of any hotel. In Connecticut, an already highly segregated state, it is all too easy to depersonalize people perceived as outsiders who are more likely to be African American, black or Latino or individuals with disabilities. That makes West Haven’s demands all the more outrageous because its own consolidated housing plan relies on New Haven shelters to address homelessness within its own borders. Yet in a time of need, the town tried to avoid fulfilling their obligation to reciprocate. In the interest of public health, shelters across the state are moving residents to hotels during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont has strongly supported these actions. To our knowledge, no other municipality has attempted to derail these efforts under the guise of public safety, let alone at such an exorbitant cost. Our state cannot afford the cost of a discriminatory agenda like this during a public health crisis. In the current emergency it is vitally important to keep people housed and not give into fear. We have heard that Asian-Americans are experiencing discrimination because people believe they are carrying the virus. At the same time, people who are low income or disabled are demonized as taking advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to stop paying rent. In fact, everyone is making sacrifices for the common good. We should honor those sacrifices by taking care of everyone. If you are told to leave your housing or harassed because of your race, national origin, disability or any other protected basis, call the Connecticut Fair Housing Center at 888-247-4401 or send an email to info@ctfairhousing.org Fionnuala Darby-Hudgens is director of operations for the Connecticut Fair Housing Center.

A report received here said that the incident occurred in a Green Zone in Gokhalenagar, Pune on May 17, 2020. This Pandemic has bought extreme difficulties and hardships to the people of Northeast due to their appearance, as they fight against two viruses – first against COVID-19 and the second ‘racial discrimination’ which is equally dangerous. A Naga woman, one of the victims of racial discrimination, while speaking to NagalandExpress, described the incident that happened while they were returning to their room from Janwadi. They were 8 women from Nagaland and one guy from Nepal. As narrated, ‘They were walking back to their room from Janwadi, which is nearby their place, and some locals shouted many things in local dialect which they didn’t understand.’ ‘One man, who was having his food at the roadside threw his tiffin at the women which hit one of them in the eye and also splattered curry on the other,’ she added. When they asked why they threw the tiffin at them, they were just told to go away from there. The Naga women reported the incident to the local police on the same day and narrated the whole incident to them. Further, the police personnel said that they will call them next day for identification and further investigation, she said. The next day when the girls reached the police station, officials gave them few contact numbers to call in case any situation arises and they were sent back. The incident happened on May 17, and the culprit is still to be booked. Further details are awaited.

Also Read: Mike Pompeo accuses China of stealing American research on COVID-19  The bill introduced by Republican Senator Marco Rubio urged US President Trump to lead a tougher crackdown on China for its treatment of Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. China has consistently denied it mistreats Uighurs in its territory. The Senate's move comes as relations between the United States and China have deteriorated amid the coronavirus pandemic with the Trump administration blaming China for not taking early steps to combat the virus even as President Trump on Thursday threatened to ""cut off"" all ties with China while asserting that he does not want to talk to President Xi.  The bill was passed unanimously with a roll call and will now be presented before the House of Representatives dominated by the Democrats, once approved it will be put before President Trump to sign into law.

By Jackson Richman, JNS Four years after the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), a legal aid group in the United States, refused to put into its dinner publication an advertisement from an Israeli organization due to NLG’s support for the BDS movement, the two groups settled a lawsuit on Tuesday filed by the Israeli entity. The NLG cited its official “resolution barring us from accepting funds from Israeli organizations” as the reason it refused to place the ad from the Bibliotechnical Athenaeum, which is in Israel. The Israeli organization sued the NLG through the Lawfare Project. The settlement was approved by the New York State Supreme Court, which had already rejected two motions to dismiss by NLG. As part of the agreement, NLG must not boycott Israel, and it will accept “a statement of organizational policy drafted by the Lawfare Project on non-discrimination which must be disseminated to NLG’s chapters, staff and committees within 60 days of the settlement,” according to The Jerusalem Post, which first reported on the settlement and also reported that “the settlement stipulates that NLG ‘affirms that no resolutions it has adopted, or adopts in the future’ violate the new non-discrimination organizational policy.” The policy must be “prominently and indefinitely” displayed on NLG’s national website, per the settlement. Finally, NLG is mandated to publish a new ad from the Bibliotechnical Athenaeum that “congratulates” the NLG “for reaffirming its commitment to non-discrimination.” “This settlement makes it crystal-clear to all who seek to engage in the type of conduct BDS advocates for that such conduct is, at its core, unlawful commercial discrimination,” Benjamin Ryberg, who served as lead counsel in this case, told JNS. “This case underscores the potential consequences awaiting those who violate civil- and human-rights law by illegally discriminating against Israelis, and deters future discrimination based on national origin, citizenship, religion and all other protected classes.” David Abrams, executive director of the Zionist Advocacy Center and a representative of the plaintiff, told JNS that “the case is important because it emphasizes that boycotts of Israel and Israelis are illegal under American laws. To be sure, organizations have the right to criticize Israeli policies.” However, he continued, “when organizations start engaging in actual boycotts of Israeli persons and entities, they cross an important line, and those of us in the civil-rights legal community will fight them in the courts.”  HELP ISRAELI FARMERS PLANT NOW - BEFORE SHMITA!

Ex-Google employee James Damore has moved to dismiss his lawsuit against the internet giant two years after alleging discrimination against conservative white men. Damore worked as an engineer at Google before being fired in 2017 after criticizing the company's efforts to improve diversity among its workforce. He made the controversial assertions in a memo that circulated throughout the company, triggering an internal culture war. On Thursday, Damore and three other men involved in the suit made a written request to the Santa Clara Superior Court in California to drop the charges. Google also signed the motion, which was first spotted by Bloomberg. ""This matter is dismissed in its entirety,"" Judge Brian Walsh wrote in the order. A lawyer for the men told Bloomberg his clients are prohibited from saying anything beyond what’s in the court filing. #SiliconValleySoWhite:Black Facebook and Google employees speak out on big tech racism While Damore's discrimination allegations have been put to rest, it's no secret that tech companies including Google, Twitter and Facebook have a diversity problem. In 2018, Google pledged to focus its diversity efforts on its least-represented demographic: black and Hispanic women. The company has since made some modest gains, according to its 2020 Diversity Report. In the U.S., the percentage of black hires grew from 4.8% in 2018 to 5.5% in 2019 — a 0.7% rise, though the percentage of black and Hispanic women hired remained under 3% for each demographic.

3844,https://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/6743683/exposing-dangers-of-religious-freedom-law/,COMMENT || Bill would allow discrimination in the name of religion,"DISCRIMINATION: Equality advocate Rodney Croome says if the federal government's Religious Freedom Bill were to pass, it would actually allow discrimination in the name of religion. Picture: Supplied The Morrison government's Religious Discrimination and Freedom Bill may have been sidelined by the corona pandemic, but it has not been ditched. On Easter Monday, Senator Eric Abetz told Sky News he hopes the Bill will be brought to Parliament in 2021. Extreme times put laws to the test. If we look at this particular Bill through the lens of the pandemic we can see why it is a bad idea and should be scrapped. The government told us the Bill was meant to prevent discrimination on the basis of religion, something which we can all support. But if the Bill was to pass, it would actually allow discrimination in the name of religion, including in health care. For example, the Bill allows hospitals linked to a religion to hire staff on the basis religious belief, not competence. A doctor or nurse who is the best qualified candidate for a job at, say, a Catholic hospital could be passed over simply because they are Jewish, Anglican or don't go to church enough. If one of my loved ones is infected with COVID-19, I want them treated by people with top medical training who know what they're doing, not people who were selected because they are considered more holy. The Bill also threatens to create a competence deficit in faith-linked aged care homes by allowing those homes to hire staff based on religious belief. The problem should be obvious: the people most likely to live in aged care are those most vulnerable to coronavirus. At a critical time like this, staff caring for older Australians must be selected because they're the most professional, not the most pious. As if religious-based hiring isn't bad enough, the Religious Discrimination Bill would also allow health professionals to refuse to provide treatments they have a religious objection to. That could include refusing to sell condoms in case they were used by unmarried partners, refusing to advise on hormone treatment where it would benefit transgender people, or refusing to prescribe stem cell treatment that could help people with disability. When COVID-19 treatments or a vaccine are developed they will need to be administered widely and quickly, without the impediment of some patients fearing discrimination. During a pandemic it's more important than ever for there to be trust between health professionals and patients, trust that the Religious Discrimination Bill jeopardises by putting a practitioner's prejudice ahead of a patient's needs. In short, the Religious Discrimination Bill would apply a religious test to some vital health care services, making it harder for many people to access. Where this extra health care hurdle would have its worst impact is in regional and rural areas where good health care can already be hard to access. There are also broader problems with the Bill that could impact health care. For example, it allows ""statements of belief"" in workplaces and health care settings that could be derogatory and humiliating. The people who will suffer most from derogatory and humiliating statements will be those who fall foul of traditional religious beliefs like unmarried partners, LGBTIQ people, people with disability and members of religious minorities. The last thing any Australian should have to endure when they are seeking treatment for COVID-19, or supporting a loved one with the infection, is to be told they are sinful or bound for Hell. Another potential problem is that the religious freedoms the federal Bill would allow could be misinterpreted to mean religious people don't have to obey the pandemic rules that should apply to everyone. Already in the United States, some religious leaders and congregations are flouting social distancing laws because they believe God will protect them. Their justification for putting the community at risk is the same absolute and unfettered right to religious freedom the Morrison government's legislation seeks to enshrine. To his credit, Mr Morrison's enforcement of social distancing rules has been as tough with churches as with other community organisations. So, it makes no sense for him to continue to push a Bill that would effectively tell churches they don't have to abide by the same rules as the rest of us. Beyond all these health-related concerns the deepest problem with the Religious Discrimination Bill is that it disrupts the social bonds we need to get through the COVID-19 crisis. It allows discrimination at a time when everyone should feel they will be treated equally and with respect. It sends the message that religious belief gives you special rights and privileges as a time when what should matter most is our shared humanity, regardless of faith. It divides Australians into, ""us"" and ""them"", ""acceptable"" and ""unacceptable"", when we should be uniting to defeat a common adversary. The federal government must scrap its ill-conceived Religious Discrimination Bill. The pandemic exposes just how dangerous such divisive legislation would be.

3890,https://www.sabrangindia.in/article/un-raises-apprehensions-over-increase-hate-speech-and-discrimination-adoption-caa,UN raises apprehensions over increase in hate speech and discrimination since adoption of CAA | SabrangIndia,"Also expresses concerns about targeting of Muslims in the country  Under-Secretary-General Adama Dieng, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide has raised several key questions about the growth of hate speech and especially the targeting of the Muslim community in wake of the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the nationwide agitation against it. In a media statement released recently, Dieng said, “While the objective of the act, to provide protection to minority communities is commendable, it is concerning that this protection is not extended to all groups, including Muslims. This is contrary to India’s obligations under international human rights law, in particular on non-discrimination.” The Special Adviser also expressed concern over reports that demonstrations against the law, which occurred across some regions of India since its enactment, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, had reportedly resulted in the injury and death of civilians, attacks on religious sites, as well as an increase in expressions of hate against India’s Muslim community. The Special Adviser added that “statements such as those expressed by Member of Parliament Subramanian Swamy, that all people are not equal, and that Muslims are not in an ‘equal category’ as others are extremely alarming. Hate speech and the dehumanization of others goes against international human rights norms and values.” This elicited a sharp response from Swamy who dubbed Dieng’s claim as slander and is considering suing the UN official. Swamy tweeted saying, “UN Under Secretary General Mr.Adama Dieng slandered me in a press release in New York saying I had said in an interview to a Pakistani owned TV channel that Muslims are not equal to Hindus in Indian Constitution. This is a blatant lie so I will take steps to sue him in court.”  UN Under Secretary General Mr.Adama Dieng slandered me in a press release in New York saying I had said in an interview to a Pakistani owned TV channel that Muslims are not equal to Hindus in Indian Constitution.

3899,https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/akron-museum-allegations-politicians-repsonse-1202686489/,Akron Officials Urge Museum Workers to File Discrimination Complaints,"By Zachary Small Akron’s deputy mayor and chief of staff, Annie McFadden, has called allegations of sexism and racism inside her city’s art museum “serious.” In an email to ARTnews, she encouraged anyone with such claims to file with the Akron Civil Rights Commission, an independent body that investigates complaints of discrimination based on background, beliefs, or identity. Her comments follow last week’s ARTnews report on nearly a half-dozen such allegations against top managers at the Akron Art Museum, who some employees said have used their positions to intimidate and harass staff. The majority of these accusations, detailed in a 2019 letter anonymously sent by roughly a third of the museum’s staff to the Ohio institution’s board, focused on the actions of executive director Mark Masuoka and another senior administrator, Jennifer Shipman, who left the museum in August.  Despite audio recordings and emails capturing some of the claim in the letter, Shipman has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Former staff members said that administrators retaliated against those who raised concerns about leadership. Of the 27 employees who anonymously wrote the letter of complaint, only one remains employed by the Akron Museum, albeit on a part-time basis; the others have either resigned, been fired, or were laid off during the Covid-19 shutdown. Reacting to the letter’s allegations, Akron’s board of directors hired the law firm Kastner Westman & Wilkins, which investigated the claims and found the majority of them to have merit, according to current and former employees who were interviewed by the firm. In a statement earlier this week, Drew Engles, the museum board’s president, said that “appropriate and specific actions were taken by the museum board to comprehensively and directly address any substantiated allegations.” Citing privacy concerns, Engles said that the museum “will not engage in any form of public disclosure, even if doing so would be to the benefit of our reputation.” But the museum’s statement has not alleviated the concerns of local officials. “Leadership needs to take care of this problem immediately,” said Akron city council member Rich Swarsky, whose ward includes the state-funded museum. “Everyone is watching,” Swarsky added, referencing the controversy at the museum. “The whole community is watching to see how they address this problem. Nobody wants to see this continue.”  Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Akron Art Museum was already facing significant challenges. Membership had been down, longtime donors were suspending their gifts, and departmental budgets were being cut, according to three former managers. And federal disclosure forms also show that the museum’s revenues have dropped nearly $2.2 million between 2019 and 2017. Museum officials are now worried that published allegations of sexism, racism, and intimidation are putting a further strain on the organization’s relationship with a once-loyal base of supporters. And there may be just cause for concern. On Thursday, one of the museum’s major donors posted an open letter calling for the replacement of Akron’s management team. “It could be done through a resignation or a replacement by the board,” Rogers said in an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer, referencing Masuoka. “Of course, the longer that this management team stays in place, the worse the damage to the institution is going to become.” Rogers and his wife have donated more than $2 million for the Akron Museum’s one-acre garden that bears the names of Rogers’ parents, who were also serves as benefactors of the institution. In his letter, Roger said the museum’s board “ignored the pleas of their staff and advice from past funders and trustees” resulting in “ruined careers, departure of talent, rock bottom morale, flight of donors, and sullying of the museum’s impeccable reputation.” Akron resident Kil Smith had attended the museum’s education programs with her three children for more than seven years, but is now questioning her relationship with the city’s biggest cultural institution after reading the ARTnews report. She decided not to renew her membership last month after the museum laid off one of its educators, Amanda Crowe. “She was the only one that cared for families. I used to be happy attending the museum’s programs, but they have continued to downsize community events in favor of wedding rentals,” Smith said. “I will have to wait and see what action they take before going back.” Last week, Malissa Vernon, a museum spokesperson, characterized allegations that Akron’s response to the coronavirus pandemic was retaliatory as “flatly inaccurate.” She also stated that the museum would in the coming weeks reinstate 25 full-time employees who were deemed essential after receiving support from the Paycheck Protection Program. However, none of the laid-off workers interviewed by ARTnews have been asked back by the museum. (The federal program requires that companies reinstate any furloughed or laid-off employees to receive loan forgiveness.) Shipman, the museum’s former chief of staff and director of special projects has also denied all allegations of wrongdoing against her, despite audio records and emails reviewed by ARTnews substantiating some of the claims in the letter to the board. Following the initial ARTnews investigation, another woman has come forward to share her experiences of sexual harassment while working at the Akron Art Museum. “The racism and sexism was pretty apparent from the get-go,” said Jane Balog, who had worked as a visitor services associate at the museum for two years while studying at the local university until she was recently laid off. In July 2018, she was responsible for taking care of alcohol inventory during weddings. Balog alleges that, at one event, the groom followed her onto the dance floor and forced himself on her, trying to kiss her. “The security manager was 10 feet away and he did nothing,” she told ARTnews. During that same event, she says, she was cornered by a senior museum executive around midnight in the inventory closet. “He was drunk and started rubbing my back,” she recalled. “I was locked in the room with him. It was terrifying.” No action was taken after Balog complained about the two incidents to her supervisor, who purportedly told her that it was a normal occurrence at museum events. ARTnews corroborated Balog’s story with three coworkers whom she confided in shortly after the interaction. The senior executive did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him. The Akron Art Museum said it would not comment on personnel issues. According to an employee handbook, the museum instituted a sexual harassment policy in 2014 that included “unwelcome flirtations, advances or proposition” and “unnecessary touching of an individual.” Several employees and managers told ARTnews that they have never received formal training on the policy. (Ohio does not require employers to offer sexual harassment training, unlike states including New York and California.) In his statement, board president Drew Engles said the museum had been “inaccurately criticized,” but that the institution would “make certain that our staff has the resources to continue the excellence that has become their trademark while working in an environment that is inclusive and supportive” and include sexual harassment training when the museum reopens. At the same moment, however, current and former staff say that years of complaints about leadership have gone unanswered. “We feel gross for still working here and want to quit in solidarity, but we have no other income option,” said one employee who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. According to her, management has failed to directly address the allegations with staff or apologize for the controversy outside of forwarding Engles’ statement after it had been shared with the press. “I think Mark should resign if he cares about the institution,” said a colleague. “He knows it will be challenging for the museum to work with the community with this kind of reputation.” For Balog, she hopes that sharing her story will spur the museum to take corrective action. “I wish the board would pay attention to the rights and happiness of their employees,” she said.

3911,https://millichronicle.com/2020/05/syrian-refugees-in-turkey-face-discrimination-and-racism-university-survey/,Syrian refugees in Turkey face discrimination and racism: University Survey,"Independent online News-portal  Shockingly, one-third of the Syrian refugees in Turkey said they have faced xenophobia and racism… Istanbul – Bahcesehir University’s Center of Migration and Urban Studies in Istanbul released a survey-based report on Friday highlighting the socio-economical challenges Syrian refugees face in Turkey everyday. Ankara-based journalist Menekse Tokyay wrote a complete report about the University-survey in Arab News about the ongoing tensions between the Turkish residents and the Syrian refugees which have made the life of Syrians increasingly difficult. Hatay province of Turkey which hosts around 439,000 Syrians — which makes upto a third of the city’s total population — where already-scarce resources are stretched to a breaking point, resulting in further ill feeling towards the refugees. The survey includes a survey of 808 Syrians aged between 18 and 25 in two Turkish cities with large numbers of Syrian refugees — Hatay and Izmir, on Aegean coast, which host around 146,000 Syrians — in October and November in 2019. The official figures state that there are 1.2 million Syrian refugees aged 18-25 currently living in Turkey, which makes a third of the country’s total population of Syrian refugees. More than a half of these Syrian refugees, want to return home or move away from Turkey, because of their living conditions and the discrimination they face every day at the hands of the local Turkish residents. Omar Kadkoy, a migration policy analyst at Ankara-based think tank TEPAV, said the university report highlights the structural shortcomings of Turkey’s “harmonization policy.” “Bureaucracy is marginalizing skilled Syrians and preventing them from fulfilling their potential, hence depriving Turkey of needed, but underutilized, capabilities,” he told Arab News of Saudi Arabia. The survey also stated that 45% of Syrian youth in Turkey neither work nor go to schools, and 86.6% cannot get a certificate of equivalence for their diploma and they cannot attend university or apply for jobs. Sadly, only 4.6% of these refugees hold a Turkish work permit, due to which majority of them work in the informal sector without any social insurance, and are subjected to exploitation by their employers. The reason they choose to work in the informal sector is due to the lengthy bureaucratic procedures involved in applying for a work permit. According to Kadkoy, that same bureaucracy is exposing young Syrians to greater risks, especially in the age of COVID-19. “Under normal circumstances, working informally already means being subject to various forms of exploitation. During the pandemic, working informally turns Syrians into a disposable workforce with only a fragile financial safety net to survive the economic consequences of COVID-19,” he said. Survey states that, sectors like textile, construction and catering, hire young Syrians, but 78.8% do not receive their full salary each month. One fifth of the respondents complained about the low wages, while 16% of them complained about worst working conditions. Over half of young Syrians reportedly work 9-10 hours every day, while one-third work for at least 11 hours — which goes against the Turkey’s employment policy. Half of the respondents claimed that they could not access public services or rent a house because of their nationality. Survey further states that, at least three-quarters of young Syrians live below Turkey’s official minimum subsistence level, while only 4% receive financial support from the state. Shockingly, one-third of the Syrian refugees in Turkey said they have faced xenophobia and racism, while one-fifth cited the language barrier as a major obstacle for their integration into Turkish society. 11% of the respondents said their contact with the local community was a very bad level. According to Kadkoy, the fact that so many young Syrians are having a difficult time in Turkey and wish to leave will serve the government in two ways. “Domestically, (the government) will complicate the lives of Syrians through bureaucracy. Thus, frustrated Syrians will opt for voluntary repatriation in the future. Therefore, the government delivers its promise not to host Syrians indefinitely,” he said. “Regionally, the government will exert pressure on Brussels for further financial support (in exchange for) keeping Syrians from reaching EU borders.” 3 mins read Millennials want to be noticed and to show off their own personalities and styles.

3926,https://www.osce.org/odihr/453207,"Scapegoating of minorities during pandemic increases need for targeted action to combat intolerance and discrimination, OSCE conference concludes","OSCE OSCE VIENNA, 26 May 2020 –The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges that demand greater efforts from governments in order to build inclusive societies in the coming months and years, concluded OSCE participants at a meeting today on addressing the many dimensions of intolerance and discrimination. “Concerns related to tolerance and non-discrimination are of legitimate concern to us all,” said Ambassador Igli Hasani, Chairperson of the OSCE Permanent Council. “Intolerance and discrimination are never blind. The pandemic has made it crystal clear that we cannot be indifferent to how women and men, youth, vulnerable groups and others are targeted and affected differently if we are to ensure that they all enjoy the same rights.” Held online for the first time, more than 230 representatives of participating States, intergovernmental organizations, marginalized communities and civil society from across the OSCE region registered to discuss challenges and opportunities to strengthen tolerance during the pandemic and in the future. Participants discussed the importance of inclusive policies and coalition building in strengthening diverse and multi-ethnic societies, as well as the need for early action to prevent intolerance from escalating into open conflict. “Governments are having to make difficult decisions at the moment in order to safeguard our health while ensuring that our rights and freedoms are respected,” said ODIHR Director Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir. “As many parts of our lives have moved online, so too has intolerance and discrimination. Political leaders need to think creatively about how to counter cyberhate and other forms of intolerance so that our societies come out of the health emergency stronger and more united.” Minorities have found themselves scapegoated in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, with people of Asian backgrounds and other marginalized groups, including Roma and Sinti, refugees, and migrants, facing a surge in discrimination and hate-motivated attacks. “With challenges come opportunities, and those in power must lead the way by forging new and positive narratives of an inclusive society,” said Dr. Regina Polak, Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on Combating Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination, also focusing on Intolerance and Discrimination against Christians and Members of Other Religions. “Through dialogue, education, and civil society co-operation, State authorities have an unparalleled opportunity to promote understanding of and respect for different cultures, ethnicities, religions or beliefs.” Diverse and inclusive societies have a greater ability to learn from different ideas and traditions, and at the same time are more resilient during periods of crisis. Tools and resources to help countries strengthen democracy and build more inclusive societies can be found here. Supplementary Human Dimension Meetings are a platform for the OSCE’s participating States and OSCE institutions, as well as international organizations and civil society, to exchange views and good practices in order to find common solutions for the challenges facing societies across the OSCE region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4111,https://businessmirror.com.ph/2020/05/08/readings-from-the-book-of-repression/,Readings from the Book of Repression,"WE are all prophets and naysayers today. Not the prophet that urges its followers to sell jams and candies in exchange for salvation from the impending Rupture, but the prophet that asks and rages. A pandemic has covered the world. People are dying. Those who are expected to cure them die first. Then comes this: a closure of a huge media conglomerate, a dominant player in a field that demanded dominance not grace if one was to win the game. It is its own expert in the game of public relations, never mind if it bandies the embrace of the Family—the Kapamilya Network, as we love the hug of that label. As if a disease that does not discriminate was not enough, that mass media communications network was closed on May 5, 2020. In a few minutes, ABS-CBN was gone and with it were the radio stations spread all over the archipelago. The closure of a media facility reminded everyone of martial law years. The closure of ABS-CBN brought back memories of greater clampdown on media in 1972. It was never predicted by many when Marcos declared martial law. But it happened and we were in darkness for many years. We know what happened in those dark years—bright boys and some bright girls were developed by the Dictator to set up their own media firms. Some of them are still around us, fighting under the banner of free speech when their career had a sterling start in the years when freedom was taken from the very machinery that fed on free, unbound action. There is a small picture and a big picture in the closure of ABS-CBN The small picture is true and real. The issues raised are disturbing: The TV network is not exactly praiseworthy when it comes to political correctness in its show. People have memories of the arrogance of its personnel and celebrities. Foremost among these comments is the observation that there are prominent newscasters in the network who have remained silent about the ineptness and corruption of the administration whose action is what they are confronting now. The opposite of this is in the fans, sad that they are not able to watch anymore their favorite dramas and root for their own idols. I have no love lost with this network but it is precisely this point of aversion or neutrality that our protest makes sense. We are not getting any financial profit if ABS-CBN gets back on its feet or resumes its operation. For all their ideological claim, they will never make us part of their family. And yet we care that they be made to open again, to operate. We understand what this closure is all about: it is not about a network losing its corporate presence but the absence of choice presented. We are protesting the rights of a group whose opinion and artistry may even be opposed diametrically to us. We are protecting them whose thoughts about the arts and entertainment we may never be comfortable with. This is the big picture. This is the essence of some groups gathering a million signatures—the essence of free speech. The name that first comes to mind is, of course, ABS-CBN, because it is a fabulous entity. But outside the luster of entertainment, there are other oppressions happening. They are of the same kind, which is the trampling upon that very right of any individual or group to express their thoughts and ideas. Think of the workers out in the farms and think of the laborers not getting their wages. They are not able to speak because their position in the labor force has removed those facilities. They are outside us. Peripheralized, they are only seen with our peripheral vision. We cannot speak for them forever but we can protest and create a space for them to listen to their own thoughts, talk back, and act out those desires that have been there only in their imagination. The free TV, however flawed and manipulative, is one dramatic indicator of the democratic space slowly being coveted for manipulation by the present dispensation. It is thus wise to ask: are we on the same page in this protest? The ordinary fans lament about the loss of their own favorite telenovela. The political activist is raging at the thought that someone is out there experimenting with control. The media practitioner may have one question: am I safe? In a hall, or an office tucked somewhere in the Palace, or perhaps in a hidden room, some individuals plotted an attack. The threat, according to network insiders, had been there for days. Then one night it came: the order to cease and desist. Language is important. Lawyers salivate at the sight of complex combinations of verbs that mean the same thing. Cease and Desist. Stop and Stop. Oppressive gestures never look good. Oppression and control have to be managed by repeated assault of commands. The Book of Repression has many chapters. It can begin with stopping a person from asking a question. It can grow with complexity by commanding that the question not be written. Repression can then rise to writing and writers being banished. Then when stopping and controlling are not enough, repression kills the words that give sound to the ideas, murders the source of freedom, which is the language of a man free to confront himself and the world. To close this Book of Repression, let me say how the death of free speech did not begin with the closure of a network. It is the terminus of an experiment with a media empire and the commencement of a regime out to dictate what it wants. The prophecy has been given. Let the divination begin.

4113,https://www.straight.com/news/blind-riders-see-discrimination-in-relocation-of-victoria-bus-stops-from-curb-to-middle-of-road,Blind riders see discrimination in relocation of Victoria bus stops from curb to middle of road,"Straight Talk  A B.C. Human Rights Tribunal has rejected an application to dismiss a complaint filed on behalf of the blind. The complaint is in connection with the relocation of bus stops on a City of Victoria street from the curb the middle of the road. The so-called “floating bus stops” were installed along Pandora Avenue between Cook and Store streets, when the road was redesigned to put a protected bike lane. Bus riders now have to cross the bike lane to get to the new bus stops. That’s not a problem for people who are not blind, according to the representative complained filed by Oriano Belusic on behalf of the Canadian Federation of the Blind. It’s a different story for visually-impaired bus riders. The complaint alleged that blind people are in danger of getting hit by bikes. The blind are therefore denied a service customarily available to all because of their disability, which is a violation of the B.C. Human Rights Code, according to the complaint. Named respondents were the City of Victoria and BC Transit. BC Transit applied to have the complaint dismissed on grounds that it has no reasonable chances of succeeding. This was rejected by tribunal member Norman Trerise. Recapping BC Transit’s position, Trerise wrote in his reasons for decision that the transportation authority “disputes that it has a duty to accommodate the members of the Class including ensuring safety and access to and from the Floating Stop to the sidewalk”. BC Transit also argued that it had “no role to play in the City’s decision to utilize Floating Stops or Crosswalks”. The complaint asserted that “by servicing the Floating Stops Transit became a party to the City’s discrimination by virtue of their denial of meaningful access to public bus transportation by blind persons”. In his reasons for decision issued Wednesday (May 20), Trerise stated that the issue in this case is “whether the Class has experienced an adverse impact from Transit’s service of the Floating Stops”. “The discrimination which is complained of is that the members of the Class are unable to reach the doors of the bus due to the danger presented by cyclists who do not reliably stop for pedestrians at the Stop Crosswalks,” Trerise noted. A “second potential incident of discrimination for members of the Class is that they are prevented from leaving the Floating Stops and accessing the curb for the same reason,” according to the tribunal member. Based on Trerise’s review of videos, a “substantial minority of cyclists filmed approach the Crosswalks at a pace significantly too quick to allow them to safely stop for a pedestrian stepping into the Crosswalks”. “For a sightless person such as a member of the Class it seems unlikely that they could reliably determine when it is safe to step into the Crosswalk as a cyclist approaches – assuming that they would even know that a cyclist was approaching,” according to Trerise. The protected bike lane was launched in May 2017. On its website, the City of Victoria states that transit users have “raised crosswalks to access the ‘floating bus stops’”. Trerise is “satisfied that the evidence suggests the members of the Class are adversely impacted by the use of the Floating Stops because they are effectively prevented access to the Floating Stops or from such Floating Stops to the curb”. “As a result, they are denied bus service along the relevant length of Pandora Street,” Trerise noted. With the dismissal of BC Transit’s application, the complaint is headed to a hearing by the tribunal. I got super vivid dreams after my 2nd dose of Pfizer.

You are here: by Kahawa Tungu May 6, 2020, 11:38 AM Is racism alive and well in Tanzanian international schools? This is one disturbing question that many social media users have been left pondering after an alumnus of the United World College East Africa detailed about the racial discrimination she experienced while a student at the institution. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Kemilembe Mugangala, who once served as President of the School’s Student Council, called out the institution formerly known as International School Moshi (ISM) for tolerating racism against black students in its Arusha and Moshi campuses. UWC East Africa is a member of the United World College network launched in 2019. The latest publicly known incident of racism at the institution, Ms Mugangala who graduated from Moshi campus in 2016 says, happened not more than six months ago. But first, let us dig into her first-hand experience in ISM some nine years ago. Ms Mugangala says her first encounter with the menace was in 2011 when she was in 8th grade. She got in trouble for calling out an Italian teacher who said he hated Tanzanians and hated being in Tanzania. Since then her life at the institution changed for worse. Read: Tanzania’s Health Minister Orders Suspension Of Gov’t Influenza Laboratory Boss, Appoints Committee To Probe “Questionable” COVID-19 Cases She claims that the discrimination was so bad that black students who were regarded as “dumb” were separated from the whites during lessons. “In 10th grade we had two math classes: for the “smart” & “slow” ones (Math A&B). They put all the Black …kids in Math B. I had to fight and prove my math skills just to be put in Math A because I was not going to let no white man tell me I’m dumb cuz of my race (ISM), ” she said. “I got suspended-ish in 12th grade (backfired cuz my mum lit the school up), for something I did not do.” … kids in Math B.

I got suspended-ish in 12th grade (backfired cuz my mum lit the school up), for something I did not do… — G’s fave daughter 💯 (@oluwa_imek) May 5, 2020 Some white teachers went to the extent of sexually assaulting black girls, she says. “White staff were PREDATORS. A few staff sexualised Black girls. Our head of campus at the time, would just walk into our boarding house as he had a fetish for seeing black girls naked. In my senior year, he got a 17-year-old staff’s child pregnant (ISM), ” she said.

They eventually stopped giving us a hard time because we really couldn’t care.

Black teachers were never allowed to speak against white teachers. If they did; they would jeopardise their contracts & have them terminated for the following school year. (ISM) — G’s fave daughter 💯 (@oluwa_imek) May 5, 2020 “Black teachers were never allowed to speak against white teachers. If they did; they would jeopardise their contracts & have them terminated for the following school year. (ISM)” she added. “International teachers always overstayed their visas and work permits. When immigration would come, they would pay HR (a Tanzanian) to cover up their mess and leave (ISM). “The school board & administrators would always exploit and abuse the ancillary staff (ISM).” I could go on & on about the shit I’ve seen and experienced. I’ve been around white people MY entire life. If they aren’t racist, they somehow without a fail find a way to invalidate your pain & experiences. It’s enough I suffer in their countries, but I won’t suffer in mine!! — G’s fave daughter 💯 (@oluwa_imek) May 5, 2020 Because of what she went through, Ms Mugangala, who is currently a senior at Drake University, has been following on the safety and well-being of students at the institution. In an interview with Kahawa Tungu, Ms Mugangala said that in January this year she learnt of an incident of a Tanzanian student at the institution who had been a victim of racist remarks. Sadly, the institution tried so hard to cover up the incident and protect the white student despite protest from the student community. Read Also: Magufuli Now Says Tanzania’s COVID-19 Cases Inflated, Blames Scientists, “Faulty” Donated Testing Kits Ms Mugangala wrote to the institution’s Director Anna Marsden to protest the injustice. But she denied cover-up claims. “It has been brought to our attention (we the alumni of ISM) that a student racially attacked a Tanzanian student through using racial slurs, and in short calling them a “NIGGER”. We are also aware that the school investigated the incident however we are not pleased or satisfied with the outcome of the incident. As an international institution, we would have expected more social awareness and responsibility from within our community, ” a letter to the director reads.  The institution has further been accused of victimizing the abused students while perpetrators go unpunished. “It has also been brought to our attention that this particular student has used other derogatory terms at the school e.g. referring to Black people as ‘monkeys’. We are also fully aware that this incident was brought up with the administration, faculty and staff.

This is very upsetting, ” the letter reads. Ms Mugangala has vowed not to back down in the fight against racism in her alma mater and hopes that the sacrifice will pay someday. “Although we write this letter with a huge sense of disappointment, we are hopeful that the UWCEA administration is going to take our concerns on board and are hopefully, going to work towards creating a sustainable future that holds all individuals responsible for their actions through upholding the mission statement and core values of the UWC Movement. This is key if the school is indeed committed to creating a safe environment for everybody to thrive, ” she added.     Email your news TIPS to news@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254708677607.

4269,https://www.forbes.com/sites/heidilynnekurter/2020/05/12/3-ways-to-protect-your-employees-from-cyberbullying-and-digital-discrimination/,3 Ways To Protect Your Employees From Cyberbullying And Digital Discrimination,"Workplace cyberbullying and digital discrimination increases stress, reduces mental and physical ... [+] well-being, reduces job satisfaction, and decreases performance. As companies shift to remote work, cyberbullying and digital discrimination are on the rise. The recent cyberbullying scandal at luggage startup Away, exposed CEO Steph Korey for mistreating her employees through their internal communication platform, Slack. Workplace bullying has only recently started to gain the attention it deserves but at the unfortunate cost of extreme cases. While every state has an anti-bullying law, not all states have policies enforcing the law. For this reason, not every company and incident is held to the same standard. Furthermore, bullying, cyberbullying and related behaviors are treated differently due to a lack of federal law. Regardless if a policy is currently in place or not, managers and employers should make it known that cyberbullying and digital discrimination won’t be tolerated. Additionally, employees should be made aware of impending consequences. Cyberbullying shouldn’t be treated any differently than if bullying were happening in the office. Jennifer Walde, director of operations at WikiLawn, stated cyberbullying can be handled with a general bullying policy but the means of reporting and investigating the incidents have to be different. Here are three ways companies can protect employees from cyberbullying and digital discrimination. Establish A Clear Reporting Process Companies shouldn’t waste any time responding to a complaint or concern. Kia Roberts, principal and founder, Triangle Investigations, shared, establishing a process consists of interviewing witnesses, keeping thorough documentation and making a conclusion, and perhaps most importantly—figuring out what corrective measures will be taken if it is established that cyberbullying occurred. Employers can take a proactive approach to prevent cyberbullying or repeat incidents by implementing cyberbullying training and policies. This provides a variety of benefits such as   A third-party anonymous reporting channel gives workers the outlet to report a problem when they don’t feel comfortable going to HR or their manager. According to SHRM, in 2018, 57% of misconduct reports were anonymous. While some may argue that anonymous hotlines aren’t effective, 57% is a substantial amount. The reason people believe hotlines are ineffective are due to companies not taking reports seriously or employees not knowing how or where to make a report. Here are a few ways employers can improve their anonymous reporting structure:   In their 2019 Definitive Corporate Compliance Benchmark Report, Navex Global, an industry leader in ethics and compliance software, shared “a reporting channel typically consists of telephone, web, mobile and other whistleblower channels through which employees and other stakeholders can make reports.” Make Policies Accessible Targets of cyberbullying and digital discrimination often hesitate to report incidents due to fear of retaliation, losing their job, or not being taken seriously. More often than not, companies don’t have their policies accessible, therefore, employees believe they’re not protected. As a result, incidents go unreported, the bullying continues and the performance and engagement of the employee deteriorate. Since a majority of traditional workers are working from home now, when cyberbullying occurs, it has a significant impact on their mental and physical health. Natalia D’Souza, lecturer at Massey University in New Zealand, whose research focuses on bullying and cyberbullying, shared “workplace cyberbullying can extend into targets’ home lives and act as a constant stressor, preventing them from unwinding and replenishing their coping resources.” Dr. Dianne Ford, professor of information systems and organizational behavior at the Faculty of Business Administration, further explained “home is typically a safe space for employees. However, when virtual harassment occurs in the home space, the safe buffer is removed and is associated with greater fear of future harassment.” Workplace cyberbullying typically occurs through email, social media, internal communication platforms, video calls or text message. The National Cyber Security Alliance shares examples of each type of bullying here. In order to be effective, company policies need to clearly communicate how incidents should be reported. For example, if a policy dictates to report cyberbullying to a direct manager, yet the manager happens to be the bully, the policy should provide alternatives such as calling a hotline or reporting to human resources. This helps avoid confusion and prevents the target from feeling silenced. Demonstrate Commitment And Compliance Leaders are the role models that nurture a healthy work environment. Employees look to their managers to see what’s tolerated and what’s not. When policies are enforced inconsistently, employees second-guess the organization’s commitment to integrity, safety and their employees wellbeing. Managers have a moral responsibility to protect their workers from bullying. Everyone, regardless of rank or title, should be treated fairly and face the same consequences when they abuse policies or mistreat others. Demonstrating commitment and compliance cultivates a culture that ensures individuals feel safe, valued, comfortable and heard. While companies can’t monitor every Zoom call or private communication, they should make it a point to monitor public channels, immediately address disrespectful video conference comments and take every complaint seriously.

4359,https://freedomhouse.org/article/state-sponsored-religious-discrimination-rises-pandemic,State-Sponsored Religious Discrimination Rises with the Pandemic,"Perspectives May 18, 2020 The health crisis has provided both motivation and cover for increased persecution of minority faith groups. Senior Program Associate Volunteers in India distribute food during the month of Ramadan to people who are unable to make money in the emergence of COVID-19. Image credit: Sanjoy Karmakar / Shutterstock.com  At the height of the Black Death in the 14th century, rumors circulated throughout Europe that Jews were deliberately transmitting the plague by poisoning wells. Rather than quell these rumors, some governments effectively endorsed them and incorporated them into official policy. In 1349, the city fathers of Brandenburg passed a law that preemptively condemned the Jewish community for spreading the disease:  Similarly during the latest global pandemic, some governments have blamed minority faith groups for the outbreak of the coronavirus and used the crisis to justify further repression of religious communities that had already been suffering from severe marginalization. As governments around the world respond to COVID-19, local activists and democratic partners must help ensure that political leaders are not exacerbating tensions between religious groups, and that official actions aimed at fighting the virus do not single out and restrict the rights and religious practices of minority faith communities. In a number of countries that have faced outbreaks of the coronavirus, political leaders have verbally lashed out against certain religious minorities, using hateful language in their speeches, official statements, and social media posts that has widened social divisions and fueled bigotry among their supporters. Over the past several weeks, India has emerged as the most prominent example of this phenomenon. As media outlets and human rights organizations—including Freedom House—have reported, prominent politicians in the right-wing government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have demonized the country’s Muslim community, which they hold responsible for spreading the coronavirus. Yet India is hardly the only country whose officials’ words have reinforced widespread prejudices against religious minorities. In Cambodia, for instance, a Facebook post in March by the Ministry of Health referenced groups of people who had contracted the virus, including adherents of “Khmer Islam.” The post was followed by a barrage of hateful online comments aimed at the country’s small Muslim community. Despite the government’s subsequent attempts at damage control, Cambodian Muslims have since reported facing increased discrimination from their Buddhist neighbors. In addition to engaging in divisive language, some leaders have implemented policies that disproportionately hinder the rights and freedoms of their nation’s minority religious groups, supposedly as a means of combating the spread of the coronavirus. Officials in Pakistan’s Balochistan Province have blamed Shia Muslims from the ethnic Hazara minority for the spread of the coronavirus. In the provincial capital, Quetta, authorities completely sealed off two Hazara areas, forbade government employees from traveling to Hazara neighborhoods, and furloughed Hazara policemen due to a suspicion that they were infected. Similarly in Saudi Arabia, where Shias are in the minority overall, the Shia-majority governorate of Qatif was placed under full lockdown on March 9, after a group of Shias tested positive for COVID-19 following religious pilgrimages to Iran. Because Qatif was the only governorate to be completely locked down, the actions drew charges of unfair treatment from Shia residents, who have long been marginalized by the Sunni-dominated government in Riyadh. The lockdown has been eased in recent weeks, but a curfew and other severe restrictions on movement are still in place. Some analysts worry that the regime will weaponize the crisis to extend some restrictions indefinitely, preventing Shias from strengthening ties with their coreligionists in neighboring countries. In Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka, the government has needlessly suppressed the Muslim minority’s burial practices by making cremations compulsory for coronavirus victims. International experts say that burial and cremation are both acceptable ways of dealing with the bodies of COVID-19 victims, and Sri Lankan Muslim leaders and human rights groups argue that the cremation decree is a violation of religious freedom. Resentment against the policy has deepened since a Muslim family claimed that authorities coerced them to sign a consent form for a family member’s cremation, despite subsequent tests showing that she did not die of COVID-19. Some governments have also discriminated against religious minorities by excluding them from programs aimed at assisting COVID-19 victims, or by providing them with less support than is offered to citizens from the majority group. In some areas of Pakistan, for example, authorities have reportedly refused to give food aid to Christians and Hindus, stating that assistance is reserved for Muslims. In India, both private and government-run hospitals have been accused of providing Muslim COVID-19 patients with lower-quality care. In the state of Gujarat, which is governed by Prime Minister Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, a government hospital is placing Muslim and Hindu coronavirus patients in separate wards, prompting accusations of apartheid. In each of these cases, the scapegoating has not occurred in a vacuum. Rather it has come after years or even generations of social and political marginalization. This reality underscores the need for international partners and local human rights activists to combat all forms of discrimination and bigotry during ordinary times, because such patterns can erupt into something far deadlier during a period of crisis like a global pandemic. Many countries whose governments are deeply antagonistic toward minority faith groups have not yet faced coronavirus outbreaks on the scale of those in India or Pakistan. As more nations experience massive increases in new COVID-19 cases, defenders of fundamental rights should pay close attention to elites’ rhetoric and policy choices vis-à-vis religious minorities and other vulnerable communities, who will likely bear the brunt of any effort to shift blame for flawed government responses and the suffering of the population as a whole.

Red light! ANALYSIS/OPINION: Even as the COVID-19 crisis dominates the headlines, the business of government continues. President Trump and his administration are to be commended for the ways they’ve cut federal red tape to ease the burden on the private sector as it responds to the crisis, searches for a cure and develops a vaccine. It would be nice if that effort spilled over into other aspects of what the government does, particularly where policies imposed by the Obama administration on its way out the door remain in effect. A politically competent administration would have that cleaned up long ago. Mr. Trump’s White House, still finding its sea legs with just months to go before voters go to the polls, still has a lot of work to do. Over at the U.S. Department of Labor, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), which promotes affirmative action among contractors doing government work, is still using Obama-era rules allowing statistical analysis of hiring and promotion data alone to sue companies it alleges commit discrimination based on race. TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure billMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestream As we’ve learned during the COVID-19 crisis, reliance on statistics alone can lead to bad decisions as it has in Oracle v. U.S. Department of Labor, which was rolled out two days before Mr. Obama and Labor Secretary Tom Perez — now the chairman of the Democratic National Committee — left office. The case and others like it involved high-tech companies accused of discriminatory wage practices based on statistical analysis alone without any evidence anything of the kind had occurred. It should have been quashed the first week the new team was in place. Allowing lawsuits like these to go forward harasses business, extorts cash that somehow always seems to end up in the coffers of so-called social justice groups whenever a settlement is reached and conflicts with Trump policies in other areas that, before the pandemic hit anyway, augured the arrival of a strong period of economic growth. Policy experts in this area have urged Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia — who, as a former solicitor of Labor surely understands the department’s authority to pursue these suits is at best questionable — to terminate them. Instead, the current solicitor, Kate O’Scannlain, has allowed them to continue. We can’t understand why. The evidentiary system is basic to American jurisprudence especially when, as the old saying goes, “Figures don’t lie but liars can figure.” To allow the manipulation of numbers alone to stand as proof of discrimination will lead to hundreds if not thousands of lawsuits and potential lawsuits that will enrich the trial bar and the organized American left while doing nothing for workers — including those who experience actual discrimination on the job site in matters of pay, promotion and other areas of compensation. What’s made things worse is that the organized left has engaged in the fight the right continues to dither. Groups like Democracy Forward, which was founded for the specific purpose of using the courts to force the Trump administration to keep the policies of his immediate predecessor in place and is whose staff is populated with veterans of the Obama administration, Team Clinton and other prominent Democrats are taking steps to achieve what they were set up to do. The group brags online they’ve already filed 100 suits with this objective in mind. Along with the National Women’s Law Center, it filed a motion to intervene in the Oracle case in mid-March to defend the OFCCP’s enforcement authority on behalf of the Communications Workers of America and the United Steelworkers. What could have been settled quietly has now become a battle royale, one the good guys will probably have to spend considerable political capital to win. Thanks to the Department of Labor’s failure to act sooner, any victory achieved in the short-term may turn out to be pyrrhic in the long run. Even if the policy is changed, those who advocate for a statistics-only approach to discrimination claims could go back into court and find a judge who will affirm it as sufficient to prove discrimination. That might be upheld on appeal, dragging it out further, until it gets before the U.S. Supreme Court which, given the current lineup, would likely find it unconstitutional. But at what cost? In the meantime, there’s no guarantee Congress might not come along and pass something that would legitimize the statistics-only approach in U.S. law — something a president who isn’t Donald Trump would likely sign. There are a lot of lessons here for Mr. Trump and future administrations, but the most important one is to take care of problems early, before they fester and grow, and the fix becomes costly indeed.

4392,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/26/age-discrimination-laws-cdc-coronavirus-guidance-c/,"Age discrimination laws, CDC coronavirus guidance create dilemma for employers","Sign In Guidelines say workers who fall into vulnerable categories shouldn't return to work until phase three Manage Newsletters The fall of sexual predator Andrew Cuomo Anti-gun lobbyist David Chipman unsuited to run the ATF Where are the illegal immigrants going? Employers reopening businesses face a dilemma with older workers: Follow health guidance against using employees at high risk for COVID-19, or heed age discrimination laws. It’s a Catch-22 that has lawyers ready to pounce. “We may be looking at a wave of age discrimination lawsuits because some employers might treat those categories differently,” said David Barron, a labor and employment lawyer in Texas. TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure billMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestream AARP, the powerful lobby for Americans 50 and older, also is sounding an alarm. “All employers should be advised that age discrimination is not only illegal but also bad for business,” said Susan Weinstock, vice president of financial resilience programming at AARP. Employees must be evaluated based on their skills, not age, regardless of the coronavirus, she said. “COVID-19 is having devastating impacts on people regardless of age or any other characteristic,” she said. “Employers need to think about the health and safety of workers, managers and customers alike. Social distancing, more regular deep cleaning of workplaces, telework and the like can all help.” That advice doesn’t dovetail neatly with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency lists people 65 and older among the most vulnerable for COVID-19. The list also includes people with preexisting conditions such as obesity, diabetes and asthma. The CDC’s “Opening up America Again” guidelines say workers who fall into vulnerable categories shouldn’t return to work until states enter phase three. Phase three is the final stage of reopening, when the country returns to normalcy after an extended downward trend in new cases and hospitalizations. Advanced age has been the dominant distinguishing characteristic in deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In New York, which ranks as the hardest-hit state with more than 23,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, the state Health Department reports that people 60 and older account for 85% of the fatalities. In Maryland, where more than 2,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, people 60 and older account for 92% of the deaths, according to state data. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, is working on a major package of liability protection for businesses sued by people claiming they contracted COVID-19 at places of business. The threat of lawsuits, Republicans say, creates a huge hurdle for reopening businesses. “Our legislation is going to create a legal safe harbor for businesses, nonprofits, governments and workers and schools who are following public health guidelines to the best of their ability,” Mr. McConnell said. His office would not confirm whether the proposed protections would cover age discrimination lawsuits. Congressional Democrats oppose coronavirus liability protections. “Especially now, we have every reason to protect our workers and our patients in all of this,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. “So we would not be inclined to be supporting any immunity from liability.” Still, as more states ease stay-at-home orders, businesses will have to consider how quickly to bring back at-risk employees and how to protect them when they do. President Trump has suggested that older teachers should not return to school campuses in the fall. “I don’t think that you should have 70-year-old teachers back yet. They should wait until everything is gone,” Mr. Trump said at a Rose Garden press conference. “I don’t think you should have a professor who is 65 and has diabetes or has a bad heart back necessarily or someone who is older than that.” The American Federation of Teachers, which is rarely on the same page as Mr. Trump, made a similar recommendation to keep at-risk teachers out of schools when they reopen. “COVID-19 disproportionately affects people 65 and older and those with underlying chronic health conditions. Reopening plans should consider providing these workers with the option to deliver instruction remotely while students are in the building, with students under the supervision of qualified staff,” the union said in its 21-page plan for reopening schools. The Americans with Disabilities Act mandates that employers make accommodations in the workplace for employees with some preexisting conditions. It has no equivalent mandate for seniors. Many workplaces, including retailers and most businesses in the service industry, cannot offer work-from-home options. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is not modifying its mission to enforce employment laws that prohibit discrimination for age when workers are older than 40, or for color, religion, sex, national origin or disability. “The EEOC wouldn’t handle age discrimination suits in the COVID-19 era any differently than other litigation,” EEOC spokeswoman Christine Saah Nazer said. Mr. Barron, the employment lawyer, said he is watching how employers handle requests for accommodations from elderly workers who might be fearful of travel or are required to wear masks. Some elderly may wish to return to work despite attempts to keep them home based on CDC warnings on increased hospitalizations and death rates from COVID-19. “What I am telling employers is: Be very, very flexible and cognizant that this is a very new area of the law and we don’t know how it is all going to shake out,” Mr. Barron said.

The US Department of Commerce announced the sanctions on Friday, saying they were triggered by human rights abuses against Uighurs and other minority groups in Xinjiang in China's far northwest. Beijing urged Washington to reverse the decision, saying the Commerce Department had ""stretched the concept of national security"" to ""meddle in China's affairs and harm China's interests"". ""China will take all necessary measures to protect the legal rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing. The Commerce Department said the nine parties were ""complicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labour and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs"" and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. All nine are now subject to restrictions on exports from the US, the department added. Washington has been increasingly active in its criticism of China's treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, and in October blacklisted 28 entities involved in alleged rights violation there. The US House of Representatives and Senate are yet to reconcile similar acts approved last year that would seek sanctions on officials over abuses, and restrict exports of surveillance gear and other equipment seen as assisting in repression in Xinjiang. An estimated one million mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are being held in internment camps in Xinjiang. Uighur activists say China is conducting a massive brainwashing campaign aimed at eradicating their distinct culture and Islamic identity. China describes the camps as vocational training sites intended to offer an alternative to Islamic extremism. Tensions are also growing between the world's two largest economies after President Donald Trump accused China of misleading the world on the origins of the coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Beijing has furiously denied the allegation, and its foreign minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington was pushing both sides to ""the brink of a new Cold War"".

A modification to the language in these policies added “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” as protected classes. The previous LCS policies protected students and employees from discrimination and harassment on the basis of “sex, race, color, national origin, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability” and other characteristics, but did not include sexual orientation. The use of the “he” or “she” pronouns also was eliminated from the policies, and replaced with a more inclusive, general reference of “they/them,” “students” or “personnel.” Board Chairwoman Susan Morrison said she reached out to the Virginia School Boards Association and division staff to get feedback on the policy revision. Morrison said several other Virginia school districts are considering adopting more inclusive language. The board has discussed the revision for months, after the proposed policy changes were reviewed by legal counsel and presented to the board in January by the LCS instruction and program policy work group for adoption. The issue was discussed further at the board’s February and April meetings and was back for action Thursday. “I know we’ve addressed [these policies] for several months; I think we’ve really spent a lot of time to make sure we get this right,” board member Robert Brennan said. Members of the public have addressed the board at its past meetings in support of the language change, and all seven public comments sent to be read and played at Thursday’s meeting encouraged board members to adopt the language change. The next school board work session is scheduled for 5 p.m. May 19, and the next school board meeting is scheduled for 5 p.m. June 2. Both will be held virtually and streamed on YouTube.

4507,https://www.dailywire.com/news/gofundme-suspends-candace-owens-fundraiser-after-she-criticized-george-floyd-owens-blatant-discrimination,GoFundMe Suspends Candace Owens’ Fundraiser After She Criticized George Floyd; Owens: ‘Blatant Discrimination’,"GoFundMe has suspended a fundraiser for a cafe in Birmingham, Alabama, set up by African-American conservative commentator Candace Owens after she posted a viral video declaring that she does “not support George Floyd and the media depiction of him as a martyr for black America.” The fundraising platform says it suspended the account because of Owens’ alleged “repeated pattern of inflammatory statements that spread hate, discrimination, intolerance and falsehoods against the black community at a time of profound national crisis.” The targeting of the campaign, Owens blasted back, is “a blatant form of discrimination.” The Owens-GoFundMe conflict began with the leak of a private text from one of the owners of Parkside Cafe to two managers Friday which described George Floyd — the 46-year-old African-American man who died while a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, sparking a wave of protests and riots — as a “thug” and protesters as “idiots” (formatting adjusted): We should go up one or two dollars on everything until June 10th. Call it a protest tax because all the idiots that went to the protest are responsible for us not being able to open normal hours. Any employees that went or are still going should resign. Mr. Floyd was a thug, didn’t deserve to die but honoring a thug is irresponsible. The owner later cited Owens’ viral video highlighting Floyd’s criminal record as part of the reason he concluded Floyd was a “thug.” In the video, Owens also criticized the African-American community for “demand[ing] support and justice for the people in our community that are up to no good” The cafe apologized for the sentiments express in the private text, but that did not quell the mounting outraged directed against the cafe. In response, Owens created a GoFundMe on Saturday for Parkside titled “Mob rule has no place in America”: This is the Parkside Café, a restaurant and bar in Birmingham, Alabama that is operated by a man named Michael Dykes. This week, Michael Dykes watched my video which garnered 100 million views in 42 hours, about the irresponsibility of the George Floyd protests and riots. Michael agreed with me and in frustration, wrote a private text to one of his colleagues about how destructive the protests were and how they are placing further burden on small business owners who are struggling to stay alive after the Coronavirus lockdowns — and now cannot open because of the riots. Michael also agreed with my sentiment that George Floyd did not deserve to die, but also, that he had a criminal record that was not worthy of the heroic characterizations the media is spinning today. An employee of his decided to leak these private text messages, quit her job, and has now encouraged a mob of people to boycott the Parkside cafe. Local media is adding further fuel to the condemnation aby (sic) demanding he answer for his private text message exchange. I AM SICK OF THE MOB RUINING PEOPLE’S LIVES. PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. The left specializes in mobs of hate and destruction. Let’s create a reciprocal movement of patriot love and support the Parkside cafe. As reported by AL.com, within an hour, Owens’ campaign raised about $80,000 and raised a total of $205,000 before GoFundMe shut it down. “About 6,000 donors had contributed to the campaign as of 8 p.m. on Saturday, and it had more than 85,000 shares and a plethora of comments,” the outlet notes. The fundraising platform provided the following statement on why it suspended the campaign: GoFundMe has suspended the account associated with Candace Owens and the GoFundMe campaign has been removed because of a repeated pattern of inflammatory statements that spread hate, discrimination, intolerance and falsehoods against the black community at a time of profound national crisis. These actions violate our terms of service. Furthermore, the Parkside Cafe has clearly condemned the comments that initially led to this campaign. While GoFundMe canceled the campaign, it has agreed to give the money already donated by the thousands of supporters to the cafe. Owens took to Twitter on Sunday to call out GoFundMe for targeting the campaign: After raising $205,000 in a few hours [GoFundMe] decided to halt my campaign for the Parkside Cafe in Alabama. At their discretion, they deemed that funds raised for a conservative business constitutes “intolerance.” They WILL however give the funds raised thus far to the cafe. While I am glad they will give the funds raised this far to the cafe to the owner, I am angry that such a blatant form of discrimination is acceptable by [GoFundMe]. There was NOTHING intolerant or violent about raising funds to help a conservative business owner. In a follow-up post, Owens said GoFundMe’s actions follow a pattern of social media platforms targeting conservatives. “Once again, conservatives and Trump supporters need to adapt to a world that tells us that our very existence is unacceptable,” she wrote. “That our ideas, thoughts, and now even our charitable efforts are unacceptable. That threatening, boycotting, and cancelling us is okay.” While I am glad they will give the funds raised this far to the cafe to the owner, I am angry that such a blatant form of discrimination is acceptable by @gofundme.

4569,https://www.mic.com/p/the-supreme-court-rules-that-lgbtq-workers-are-protected-from-job-discrimination-22981288,The Supreme Court rules that LGBTQ workers are protected from job discrimination,"On Monday morning, the Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does in fact protect LGBTQ individuals from workplace discrimination. The ruling, based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, declares that discrimination on the basis of ""sex"" includes discrimination due to sexual orientation or gender identity. The court ruled 6-3 in favor of LGBTQ workers — somewhat surprising given the court's conservative lean. Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts jointed the four liberal justices in the ruling. Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion for the court, saying, ""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids."" The court's ruling came from a combination of three cases: Bostock v. Clayton County, in which a Georgia worker argued he was fired from his state government job after his employer learned he joined a gay softball league; Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, in which a skydiving instructor said he was fired after he told a female customer he was gay in an effort to make her feel more comfortable with a tandem dive; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which centered on transgender discrimination specifically as Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman, sued because she was fired after she told her devoutly religious employer that she intended to dress according to her gender identity. The Associated Press estimates there are 8.1 million LGBTQ workers in the U.S., noting that protections at the federal level are crucial because most states don't have sex- or gender-based discrimination protections in place. In his dissent, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the majority decision was ""preposterous. Even as understood today, the concept of discrimination because of 'sex' is different from discrimination because of 'sexual orientation' or 'gender identity.'"" Justice Clarence Thomas joined Alito's dissent. Justice Brett Kavanaugh also dissented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4735,https://www.ketv.com/article/supreme-court-rules-lgbtq-people-protected-from-job-discrimination/32868051,Supreme Court rules LGBTQ employees protected from job discrimination,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Video above: How two landmark court rulings changed the lives of same-sex couples in America forever The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a landmark civil rights law protects LGBTQ people from discrimination in employment, a resounding victory for LGBTQ rights from a conservative court. The court decided by a 6-3 vote that a key provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 known as Title VII that bars job discrimination because of sex, among other reasons, encompasses bias against LGBTQ workers. “An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court. Justices Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas dissented. “The Court tries to convince readers that it is merely enforcing the terms of the statute, but that is preposterous. Even as understood today, the concept of discrimination because of ‘sex’ is different from discrimination because of ‘sexual orientation’ or ‘gender identity,’” Alito wrote in a dissent that was joined by Thomas. The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBTQ workers across the country because most states don’t protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBTQ people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school. The cases were the court’s first on LGBTQ rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement and replacement by Kavanaugh. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative. The Trump administration had changed course from the Obama administration, which supported LGBTQ workers in their discrimination claims under Title VII. During the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBTQ people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity. In recent years, some lower courts have held that discrimination against LGBTQ people is a subset of sex discrimination, and thus prohibited by the federal law. Efforts by Congress to change the law have so far failed. The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs. The federal appeals court in New York ruled in favor of a gay skydiving instructor who claimed he was fired because of his sexual orientation. The full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 10-3 that it was abandoning its earlier holding that Title VII didn’t cover sexual orientation because “legal doctrine evolves.” The court held that “sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.” That ruling was a victory for the relatives of Donald Zarda, who was fired in 2010 from a skydiving job in Central Islip, New York, that required him to strap himself tightly to clients so they could jump in tandem from an airplane. He tried to put a woman with whom he was jumping at ease by explaining that he was gay. The school fired Zarda after the woman’s boyfriend called to complain. Zarda died in a wingsuit accident in Switzerland in 2014. In a case from Georgia, the federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled against Gerald Bostock, a gay employee of Clayton County, in the Atlanta suburbs. Bostock claimed he was fired in 2013 because he is gay. The county argues that Bostock was let go because of the results of an audit of funds he managed. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Bostock’s claim in a three-page opinion that noted the court was bound by a 1979 decision that held “discharge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII.” Aimee Stephens lost her job as a funeral director in the Detroit area after she revealed to her boss that she had struggled with gender most of her life and had, at long last, “decided to become the person that my mind already is.” Stephens told funeral home owner Thomas Rost that following a vacation, she would report to work wearing a conservative skirt suit or dress that Rost required for women who worked at his three funeral homes. Rost fired Stephens. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio, ruled that the firing constituted sex discrimination under federal law.

(CNS) – Albertsons has agreed to pay $210,000 to settle a discrimination lawsuit alleging the manager of an Albertsons supermarket in the San Carlos neighborhood harassed employees for speaking Spanish on the job, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced Tuesday. The EEOC’s lawsuit alleged a store manager was allowed to harass employees at the Lake Murray Boulevard Albertsons in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on national origin. According to the complaint filed in San Diego federal court, employees were not allowed to speak Spanish even while on breaks, or when conversing with Spanish-speaking customers. In addition to the monetary damages, which the EEOC said will go to “a class of affected employees,” Albertsons has agreed to review and possibly revise its discrimination policies and procedures and provide training to employees and managers, with an emphasis on language discrimination. Alberstons will also be required to submit reports to the EEOC and keep records demonstrating compliance with a consent decree settling the suit. “The EEOC commends Albertsons for agreeing to meaningful and comprehensive measures to correct this situation,” said Anna Park, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Los Angeles District, whose jurisdiction includes San Diego County. “It is important for employers to train employees and make clear that their use of language in the workplace should not impact one group over another.” Christopher Green, director of the EEOC’s San Diego office, said, “Given the nature of an increasingly diverse workforce, employers should be mindful that the imposition of restrictive language policies may not comply with federal law.” Submit Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

Kavanaugh wrote in a separate dissent that the court was rewriting the law to include gender identity and sexual orientation, a job that belongs to Congress. Still, Kavanaugh said the decision represents an “important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans."" The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don’t protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBT people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school. But Monday's decision is not likely to be the court's last word on a host of issues revolving around LGBT rights, Gorsuch noted. Lawsuits are pending over transgender athletes' participation in school sporting events, and courts also are dealing with cases about sex-segregated bathrooms and locker rooms, a subject that the justices seemed concerned about during arguments in October. Employers who have religious objections to employing LGBT people also might be able to raise those claims in a different case, Gorsuch said. “But none of these other laws are before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today,"" he wrote. The cases were the court’s first on LGBT rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement and replacement by Kavanaugh. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative. The Trump administration had changed course from the Obama administration, which supported LGBT workers in their discrimination claims under Title VII. During the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity. In recent years, some lower courts have held that discrimination against LGBT people is a subset of sex discrimination, and thus prohibited by the federal law. Efforts by Congress to change the law have so far failed. The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs. Aimee Stephens lost her job as a funeral director in the Detroit area after she revealed to her boss that she had struggled with gender most of her life and had, at long last, “decided to become the person that my mind already is.” Stephens told funeral home owner Thomas Rost that following a vacation, she would report to work wearing a conservative skirt suit or dress that Rost required for women who worked at his three funeral homes. Rost fired Stephens. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio, ruled that the firing constituted sex discrimination under federal law. Stephens died last month. Donna Stephens, her wife of 20 years, said in a statement that she is ""grateful for this victory to honor the legacy of Aimee, and to ensure people are treated fairly regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.” The federal appeals court in New York ruled in favor of a gay skydiving instructor who claimed he was fired because of his sexual orientation. The full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 10-3 that it was abandoning its earlier holding that Title VII didn’t cover sexual orientation because “legal doctrine evolves.” The court held that “sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.” That ruling was a victory for the relatives of Donald Zarda, who was fired in 2010 from a skydiving job in Central Islip, New York, that required him to strap himself tightly to clients so they could jump in tandem from an airplane. He tried to put a woman with whom he was jumping at ease by explaining that he was gay. The school fired Zarda after the woman’s boyfriend called to complain. Zarda died in a wingsuit accident in Switzerland in 2014. In a case from Georgia, the federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled against Gerald Bostock, a gay employee of Clayton County, in the Atlanta suburbs. Bostock claimed he was fired in 2013 because he is gay. The county argues that Bostock was let go because of the results of an audit of funds he managed. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Bostock’s claim in a three-page opinion that noted the court was bound by a 1979 decision that held “discharge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII.” ___ Associated Press writer Ed White contributed to this report from Detroit.

Cathy Wong the city's executive committee member in charge of fighting racism and discrimination. Speaking during Wednesday's executive committee meeting, Wong, a city councillor for the Peter-McGill district who served as city council speaker until Wednesday, said ""it's an honour and an enormous responsibility"" to be given the position. As the person in charge of diversity, the French language, and the fight against racism and discrimination, Wong will be tasked with developing actions based on recommendations outlined in a report by the city's consultation office that detailed racism and discrimination across municipal institutions. The report, released Monday by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM), outlined 38 recommendations that call for sweeping changes: greater transparency, specific targets and accountability at the executive level, for everything from hiring for city positions to policing to cultural programs to housing. Wong said the OCPM report's findings are alarming and present the city with significant challenges, but she is committed to building an inclusive city. In an interview with CBC News, Wong said she is working on an ""ambitious plan,"" which would include hiring targets for visible minorities and anti-discrimination training for city managers, ""making sure that in every level and in every service, we talk about racism and discrimination."" ""I commit to working tirelessly with my co-workers on the executive committee so Montreal becomes an exemplary city in terms of diversity and inclusion,"" Wong said. ""Especially as a major employer, the city needs to lead the way."" Wong said Projet Montréal is also looking for racially diverse candidates for the next municipal election in 2021. She echoed the sentiments expressed by many people quoted in the OCPM report, who said they were tired of having reports on systemic racism and analysis of the problems without sufficient action. ""I am tired, too, of hearing analysis and consultation and reports. I need action, too, and I'm really committed to this,"" Wong said.

At a time when Black people and others are marching in opposition to police brutality and discrimination in astounding numbers, the president’s daughter bemoaned “cancel culture” and “viewpoint discrimination” for the cancellation of her planned virtual commencement address to a Kansas technical school. “Our nation’s campuses should be bastions of free speech,” Ivanka Trump tweeted on Friday night. “Cancel culture and viewpoint discrimination are antithetical to academia.

Trump included in her tweets the speech she had planned to give, which she said was pre-recorded on May 18. According to the Wichita Eagle, Jennifer Ray, a WSU associate professor of photo media, wrote an open letter in reaction to the announcement Trump would address the graduates and collected as many as 487 faculty signatures in support. In the letter, Ray said she was “horrified and disgusted” by the decision to invite Trump to speak. And let’s not forget that the president’s daughter crying over “viewpoint discrimination” is the same person who hatched the idea and “urged” her father, according to Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, to clear peaceful demonstrators from Lafayette Park with tear gas and pepper balls so the president could walk to St. John’s Church near the White House and hold up a Bible she carried in her $1,540 Max Mara handbag.

People wait to cross a street in Hong Kong. Source: AP Dozens of independent UN experts have voiced alarm over the repression of fundamental freedoms in China, demanding urgent action from the UN Human Rights Council. Around 50 special rapporteurs and other experts denounced the ""repression of protest and democracy advocacy"" in Hong Kong and urged Beijing to drop its controversial draft security law for the semi-autonomous city. They also denounced ""impunity for excessive use of force by police, the alleged use of chemical agents against protesters, the alleged sexual harassment and assault of women protesters in police stations and the alleged harassment of health care workers"". In a statement, the experts, who do not speak for the UN but report their findings to it, said they ""believe it is time for renewed attention on the human rights situation in the country"", in light of the ""moves against"" people in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. They raised ""grave concern"" over the ""collective repression of the population"", disappearances of human rights defenders, allegations of forced labour, arbitrary interferences with privacy and censorious cyber-security laws. They also said journalists, medical workers and others exercising free speech over the COVID-19 outbreak in China have allegedly faced retaliation from the authorities. The UN experts said the national security law planned for Hong Kong would ""violate China's international legal obligations and impose severe restrictions on civil and political rights"". It would also deprive Hong Kong of its autonomy and guaranteed rights, and undermine the right to a fair trial, they added while urging Beijing to withdraw the draft law. They called on the UN Human Rights Council to act with ""urgency"" to monitor Chinese human rights practices, raising the prospect of holding a special session of the council to evaluate the range of violations listed. They also said the international community should act collectively and decisively to ensure that China ""respects human rights and abides by its international obligations"". Human Rights Watch welcomed what it said was an unprecedented call for a special session of the UN's top rights body. Sarah Brooks, from the International Service for Human Rights, said the joint statement was long overdue but worth waiting for. ""The experts leave no doubt that behind the image China presents, the reality is deeply flawed -- and that it's time that governments who've preferred to stay silent take notice, and take action,"" she said.

The Ministry of External affairs (MEA) in its report said that that US government officials underscored the importance of respecting religious freedom and promoting tolerance and mutual respect throughout the year with the ruling and opposition parties, civil society and religious freedom activists, and religious leaders belonging to various faith communities. “Our principled position remains that we see no locus standi for a foreign entity to pronounce on the state of our citizens’ constitutionally protected rights,” spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said. “We have a robust public discourse in India and constitutionally mandated institutions that guarantee protection of religious freedom and rule of law,” he added.

5052,https://oklahoman.com/article/5664209/in-new-poll-oklahoma-voters-say-racial-discrimination-a-problem-protester-anger-justified/,"In new poll, Oklahoma voters say racial discrimination a problem, protester anger justified","Ongoing coverage View all related videos About 60% of likely voters in Oklahoma believe racial discrimination is a big problem in the United States, according to a new poll that also shows a majority of those surveyed said protester anger was justified over the police killing of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis. Only a third of all likely voters in the state believe race relations have worsened since President Donald Trump took office in 2017. But two-thirds of Democrats and nearly three-fourths of black voters believe relations have worsened during Trump’s tenure, according to the poll by Amber Integrated. According to the poll, only 18% of all likely voters surveyed have ever felt harassed by police, but 54% of black respondents have. Only 32% of all likely voters surveyed believe police are more likely to use excessive force against black people, but 75% of blacks believe that. The statewide poll was taken by Amber Integrated of Oklahoma City June 4-5, and the results come from a sample of 500 likely voters, with the pool weighted for party registration, gender, age and other factors. The margin of error is 4.4% at a 95% confidence level. Likely voters in Oklahoma were asked whether they consider racial and ethnic discrimination to be a big problem, a small problem, a problem of some size or not a problem. Fifty-eight percent of the total said it was a big problem: 81% of blacks, 57% of whites, 61% of Hispanics and 69% of Asians said it was a big problem. By party, 80% of Democrats, 43% of Republicans and 55% of independents said it was a big problem. Another 13% said it was a small problem, while 13% said it was a problem without specifying large or small. Only 15% overall said it wasn’t a problem. The highest percentages of respondents believing it to be a big problem were in the two congressional districts that include Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Pollster Jackson Lisle said, “A strong majority (84%) of Oklahomans think ‘racial and ethnic discrimination’ is a problem in the United States, and that majority holds across party lines and age. “There is, however, a partisan split when it comes to judging the severity of that problem. While 80 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of independents say discrimination is a ‘big’ problem, only 43 percent of Republicans say the same. However, 77 percent of Republicans say discrimination is a problem on some level.” On the question of whether protesters’ anger was justified over George Floyd’s killing on May 25, for which a police officer has been charged with 2nd-degree murder, 60% of all likely voters surveyed said their anger was at least partially justified. Floyd’s killing has sparked demonstrations around Oklahoma and the nation, as people have protested repeated incidents of police killing suspects. Statistics show blacks are more likely to be killed and that officers rarely face charges. Republicans were the least likely group to say the protester anger was justified, though 50% said it was least partially justified. “Oklahoma voters also say they understand why many are angry about racial discrimination and police brutality,” Lisle said. “When asked about demonstrations that have become unruly or violent, specifically the burning of a Minneapolis police station, 60 percent say ‘the anger that led to these protests’ was either fully or partly justified.” Lisle noted that Oklahomans have not turned against local police. The poll shows 78% of those surveyed are very or somewhat satisfied with their local police departments. “Republicans are twice as likely to say they are ‘very satisfied’ with the police than either Democrats or independents,” Lisle said. “Taken as a whole, the data suggests that Oklahoma’s electorate is universally aware of the current public conversation about racial inequity and generally sympathetic of the sentiments of those protesting injustice. However, support for local police departments remains strong, regardless of political party.” On the question of racial relations under Trump, a plurality of 40% said they had not changed since the white Republican replaced Barack Obama, a black Democrat, in the Oval Office. Of the rest, 21% said relations had improved and 36% said they had gotten worse. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the recent protests in Oklahoma, including one at which thousands of people marched to the state Capitol, may contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus. At least 60% of Republicans, Democrats and independents agreed on that. Chris Casteel began working for The Oklahoman's Norman bureau in 1982 while a student at the University of Oklahoma.

(WHEC) — One of the most historic advocacy groups in Rochester is in a mess. Out Alliance, which fights for LGTBQ equality, is shutdown. Staff got fired two weeks ago. And now one of those employees is suing for discrimination, and the lawsuit says the n-word is involved. The lawsuit is against Out Alliance, under the umbrella of the Gay Alliance of the Genesee Valley, it's board chair and former director. The person suing is Zariah Williamson. Her lawsuit alleges ""regular harassment."" ""Daily dealing with a hostile environment and dealing with discrimination based on my gender and my race,"" Williamson said. Zariah is transgender. She grew up in Rochester and graduated from the School of the Arts. She joined the Alliance at 13 and now at 26 worked for the Alliance as an educational coordinator. She was fired two weeks ago. She filed her lawsuit Wednesday. The lawsuit says the n-word was used against her when she was working in the Alliance's building. Brean: ""So people said the n-word to you?"" Zariah Williamson, suing Out Alliance for discrimination: ""And my face, absolutely."" Brean: ""How often would that have happened?"" Zariah: ""So there were two occasions when that happened."" The lawsuit says Zariah complained about getting called the n-word and comments on her gender. It says her complaints were ignored. It also says she was fired because she complained. Brean: ""How do you prove something like that, that she was fired because she complained?"" Charlie Arrowood, attorney: ""The fact is here that this was a small staff. Multiple staff members came forward with complaints about a variety of discriminatory conduct and other inappropriate conduct and rather than address any of it, almost immediately after they came forward, the entire team was fired."" Zariah was fired June 12. That's the same day the Alliance shut down. I emailed two board members and the Alliance press contact. The only thing you can find is a statement on the Alliance website posted June 12, the same day Zariah was fired. It says the COVID-19 crisis canceled ""key fundraisers"" and ""donations."" The statement says the board decided to ""discontinue the agency's operations."" The financial statements of the Alliance show a money problem years before. The net assets dropped from $384,129 in 2017 to $23,229 in 2018. Charlie Arrowood, attorney: ""They out an announcement that said they were going to regroup and restaff. So the question is why couldn't they regroup and restaff with the same staff rather than terminate everyone who happened to have complained?"" The rules say the Out Alliance has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit from the day it is officially served. The impact the COVID-19 crisis has had on the courts may delay that timeline.

5066,https://www.colts.com/news/juneteenth-action-items-irsay-scholarship-inclusion-director,The Indianapolis Colts have announced the first of several steps to battle systemic racism and other forms of discrimination,"INDIANAPOLIS —The Indianapolis Colts today announced the first of several steps to battle systemic racism and other forms of discrimination and to ensure that diversity, equity and inclusion are at the forefront of the team's business and community efforts. ""The mission of the Colts is to entertain, unite and inspire by winning the right way,"" said Jim Irsay, Colts Owner & CEO. ""That means we take our work off the field in communities across our city and state just as seriously as we what we do on the field."" ""In addition to the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and others, I have heard stunning testimonials from our players and staff about their personal experiences with racism,"" Irsay said. ""In recent weeks, you've also heard passionate words from our general manager, head coach, players and me about racism and injustice – and their specific and often intentional impact on our Black friends and neighbors – and these words will continue to be reflected in how we operate, communicate and engage."" ""We realize these are difficult and uncomfortable topics to talk about, and they certainly go beyond football. But as an Indiana business, as a responsible corporate citizen – and as people who truly care about our fellow Hoosiers – we believe that Black lives matter and that we must continue this dialogue and do what we can to inspire positive change."" Some of the first steps the team will take include: Each year, a student will be selected for the scholarship, which will cover the costs of a four-year education at Indiana University, the alma mater of Colts vice chairs & owners Casey (Irsay) Foyt and Kalen (Irsay) Jackson. If the student chooses a college other than IU, the value of four years of IU tuition would be applied toward the student's expenses at his or her school of choice. The scholarship also will cover costs associated with high school college preparation, which could include tutoring costs or tuition assistance at a college prep high school. In total, the scholarship will cover eight years of education costs for each recipient. Beginning with the eighth year, there will be eight scholars in the program at any given time. More details about eligibility and the application and selection process will be announced in the near future. The team will announce more initiatives in the upcoming weeks and months. Juneteenth, which is celebrated in Indiana and most U.S. states, commemorates the day in 1865 when Union Gen. Gordon Granger publicly read federal orders in Galveston, Texas freeing enslaved Americans in Texas. Although the Emancipation Proclamation which officially ended slavery was ordered by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, and the Civil War had largely ended, word was slow to get to Texas and enforcement of the order was not vigorous. Gen. Gordon's reading of the orders marked one of the final actions of the period that led to freedom for millions.

Ri-Karlo Handy, a Black 20-year film veteran, posted on the I NEED AN EDITOR! Facebook group on Tuesday, looking for a Black person to fill an editor role. Stunned that Handy would not consider a white person for the job, the group’s sensitive members rebuked Handy’s decision, calling it “reverse racism.” With Handy’s post getting perceived as racial discrimination, some of the members, who are presumed to be white themselves, call on the page’s admin to delete the post, Insider reported. “Those 11 words set off a firestorm in the group, leading to racist posts in the comments and a heated debate about diversity, discrimination and opportunity,” Handy said, according to The Los Angeles Times. “Several members of the group, myself included, were deeply offended by some of the responses by white editors who perceived my effort to source more editors of color as some sort of ‘reverse discrimination.’” READ MORE: Don Lemon calls out Hollywood stars by name during protest coverage Nicole French, actress and attorney, was made aware of the post by a friend, and her reaction, according to Insider, was to share some of the comments to the public. “I just decided enough was enough and I needed to collect the screenshots and put it all together,” French told Insider. French tweeted out several posts of white men complaining about Black editors given an opportunity. One of them was Nathan Lee Bush, an editor and cinematographer who has worked with several big brands such as Nike, GQ, Esquire Magazine, and Panera Bread. “As long as there’s not a peep when I specify ‘white editors only’ for my next job,” Bush wrote. “I need a white perspective on the subject matter. ‘No, you don’t get it, this is the GOOD racism this time!'” He’s also a cinematographer for @panerabread @esquire @reeses @TiffanyAndCo @saks products and @GQMagazine with @LewisHamilton pic.twitter.com/PhfHaKvFLc — Nicole French (@Nicole_saysLove) June 16, 2020  French’s posts received a response directly from the bakery-café restaurant chain.

5091,https://www.yahoo.com/huffpost/trump-reverses-transgender-patient-protections-004914150.html,Trump Reverses Rule Protecting Transgender Patients From Discrimination,"President Donald Trump’s administration finalized a new policy Friday that ends an Obama-era protection for transgender patients facing discrimination in the health care system. The now-revoked provision of the Affordable Care Act had broadened bans on sex discrimination in health care to include transgender patients, ensuring they could receive services at all hospitals and be covered under all insurance plans. Now the Department of Health and Human Services is “returning to the government’s interpretation of sex discrimination according to the plain meaning of the word “sex” as male or female and as determined by biology,” the department wrote in its announcement. The overturned section concerning transgender patients also banned discrimination against women who’d had abortions. That decision comes despite the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the National Association of Social Workers all endorsing non-discrimination policies for transgender patients. The Trump administration vowed to take this action just over a year ago. After a group of states and religious health care providers sued over that Obama rule, a federal judge agreed in 2016 to block it on a temporary basis. However, the judge has yet to issue a final ruling. The Trump administration has declined to enforce the rule since that 2016 injunction, so Friday’s announcement is more symbolic than anything. Throughout his time in office, Trump has worked to severely narrow the legal definition of sex discrimination, leaving fewer people covered under civil rights protections across several industries. Activist groups said the news was especially painful to receive during Pride Month, on the fourth anniversary of the mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. “On a day the world remembers and mourns the 49 lives lost in a senseless attack on our community four years ago in Orlando, the Trump administration has decided to continue its campaign to further discriminate and attack LGBTQ Americans, specifically transgender people,” GLAAD tweeted. “Trump and his allies never fail to show that their extreme ideology comes before people’s health, safety, and lives,” NARAL Pro-Choice America’s communications officer Adrienne Kimmell said in a statement. “This rule will hurt Americans and fall hardest on people who already face barriers to accessing healthcare. The cruelty of this administration knows no bounds.” Related... J.K.

5199,https://www.otsnews.co.uk/apology-demanded-from-southport-mp-accused-of-clear-discrimination-against-black-lives-matter-protest/,"Apology demanded from Southport MP accused of ""clear discrimination"" against Black Lives Matter protest","Southport’s Conservative MP has been told he should apologise after denouncing the Black Lives Matter protest held in the town at the weekend. Posting on his Facebook page, Damien Moore made a lengthy criticism of the event, which he’d previously asked residents not to attend. The MP stated he supported the aims behind it but his opposition was on the basis of Covid concerns, saying: “The demonstration that took part on Saturday was unhelpful and went someway to undoing our town’s efforts to tackle this pandemic, protect our NHS, and save lives.” But critics have pointed out that in the very same post he also stated that veterans who had staged their own gathering at the same time just a hundred metres or so away had his “full support”, seemingly unaware it completely undercut his own professed public health stance. Local councillor Greg Myers, who attended the Black Lives Matter event, says he believes the contradiction leaves the MP with an apology to make, explaining: “He is actually discriminating against an anti-race discrimination protest while saying he supports racial equality, it’s very confusing.” “If public health is his concern then how can he damn the BLM event in the manner he has and then not only fail to address the veteran event in the same terms but actually state they had his “full support”? Either both gatherings were wrong or neither.” “How can he wildly speculate about the BLM event increasing Covid-19 here as he did but give the other gathering a free pass and praise? It’s simply antagonistic and clear discrimination in relation to the events, to my mind.” “Mr Moore is keen to stress he supports the aims behind the BLM event and I commend him for that but this post is very mixed messaging that he must make amends for. No wonder black people are angry if that sort of nonsense is actually coming from their MP. Other residents should be too.” “There were hundreds of responses on his social media page, with many clearly unhappy over the unfair comments. Buried in there is a wishy-washy reply from him made later on saying all gatherings including those at beaches etc are wrong. That does not begin to address the problems with his post.” “He should either apologise immediately to the BLM protestors and organisers or clearly tell the veterans in the same damning terms he used against the BLM event that as far as he’s concerned, they too have endangered Southport and possibly contributed to a future Covid spike.” “Though, of course, that would be just as unfair on the vets as he’d have no proof of that claim either – especially given how the lockdown has eroded in recent weeks due to the actions of his own government.” “His credibility on the matter is further reduced by the fact that this is an MP who liked a tweet in support of Dominic Cummings as the scandal over his breaking the guidelines erupted. So he seems rather selective in his Covid position to me.” The MP’s post also claimed that social distancing was observed by “very few people” at the BLM event. It prompted a barrage of angry response from many who had been there, strongly rejecting Damien Moore’s claims. One of the event organisers, local resident Grishma Bijukumar, telling him: “If you made an effort to turn up instead of encouraging people to not come you’d have seen that everyone was socially distant and had face coverings!” Protestors pointed out that a raft of measures had been put in place to protect those attending. Stewards were in place to help reinforce the distancing and check that those not doing so were in household groups. They also handed out free facemasks to those who had failed to bring one, with hand sanitiser also on offer. Even one of the MP’s own supporters, Ann Pearmain, a former Tory council candidate, who replied to his post to commend him still acknowledged that, in fact, distancing had been observed well, stating: “When I was at the in Town on Saturday it was very peaceful, with most observing the 2m social distancing and or wearing masks! There was a positive feel, maybe there was some minor altercations, but they did not distract from the message on both sides of the coin.” Mr Moore, however, denied this and continued to repeat his claims. Cllr Myers says that the MP is trying to hoodwink residents who weren’t present over the issue to suit his own narrative and is wrong to single out the BLM event, especially given the series of steps it took: “He wasn’t there, he’s told repeatedly that distancing was well-observed and even by his own supporters but still he persists in trying to say very few did so. This is a man simply trying to justify his own poor decision-making. The vast majority of the crowd outside the town hall made a real effort.” “It was also very clear beforehand that the protest was going ahead despite his objections. At that point, it seems to me that if he was interested in public health and he was also supportive of the event’s aims, as he says, then he should have tried to do something positive to help improve the situation but he didn’t.” “I’d also been concerned about the public health risk so I contacted the organisers, who I think did a great job of trying to make sure the event was both responsible and peaceful.” “I asked what measures they were putting in place and discovered that while they intended to socially distance and for people to wear masks there weren’t any stewards to help with this.” “In that situation, I decided it was far better to offer help to try to improve things and minimise risk. It’s never going to be perfect but by taking action you massively reduce potential harm. Thankfully several of my Southport Labour colleagues agreed.” “So we volunteered to assist in a non-political capacity with our Labour hi-viz tabbards turned inside out given the human rights nature of the protest.” “The MP could easily have discovered this information and helped improve things if only he’d bothered to try.” “It was actually a privilege to be there and show support, especially after all the scaremongering that went on. The MP didn’t help with that either, subsequently stating there were violent incidents at the event.” “In fact, it centred around what I’d describe as a lone right-wing idiot who attempted to cause a confrontation. He then had to be protected from the results of his own stupidity and was quickly ejected, the police then just as promptly dealing with the matter.” Despite efforts by some to portray the event in a different light beforehand, local resident and organiser Ruby Jones made clear that it was always a local affair, commenting: “We are separate from the official BLM organisation, we are just a group of local residents who wanted to stand up for equality and give a platform to other locals who wanted to share their thoughts and experiences.” Cllr Myers says that he believes the MP’s comments only feed into attempts to stoke division in the town: “Damien Moore can try to condemn one event and not the other but I’m heartened that the vast majority on both “sides” actually respected the views of the other and ensured that the day passed peacefully.” “I think both the protestors and the veterans did Southport proud by doing so. As did the police who handled it really well. They also contacted me afterwards to say that having the stewards was certainly beneficial, so those volunteers did their bit too.” “The testimony I heard at the event from black people of all ages who live in this town has given me a far better understanding of how many residents here have a totally different experience to myself based solely on the colour of their skin. That has to change.” “Judging from the local MP’s comments, I’d suggest an apology from him for his crass handling of this matter is a good place to start.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5228,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-supreme-court-rules-that-lgbt-workers-are-protected-from-job-discrimination-2020-06-15,U.S. Supreme Court rules that LGBT workers are protected from job discrimination,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a landmark civil rights law protects LGBT people from discrimination in employment, a resounding victory for LGBT rights from a conservative court. The court decided by a 6-3 vote that a key provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 known as Title VII that bars job discrimination because of sex, among other reasons, encompasses bias against LGBT workers. “An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court. Justices Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas dissented. “The Court tries to convince readers that it is merely enforcing the terms of the statute, but that is preposterous. Even as understood today, the concept of discrimination because of ‘sex’ is different from discrimination because of ‘sexual orientation’ or ‘gender identity,’” Alito wrote in a dissent that was joined by Thomas. See also: Supreme Court refuses to take up challenges to gun-control laws The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don’t protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBT people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school. The cases were the court’s first on LGBT rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement and replacement by Kavanaugh. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative. The Trump administration had changed course from the Obama administration, which supported LGBT workers in their discrimination claims under Title VII. During the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity. In recent years, some lower courts have held that discrimination against LGBT people is a subset of sex discrimination, and thus prohibited by the federal law. Efforts by Congress to change the law have so far failed. The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs. The federal appeals court in New York ruled in favor of a gay skydiving instructor who claimed he was fired because of his sexual orientation. The full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 10-3 that it was abandoning its earlier holding that Title VII didn’t cover sexual orientation because “legal doctrine evolves.” The court held that “sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.” That ruling was a victory for the relatives of Donald Zarda, who was fired in 2010 from a skydiving job in Central Islip, New York, that required him to strap himself tightly to clients so they could jump in tandem from an airplane. He tried to put a woman with whom he was jumping at ease by explaining that he was gay. The school fired Zarda after the woman’s boyfriend called to complain. Zarda died in a wingsuit accident in Switzerland in 2014. In a case from Georgia, the federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled against Gerald Bostock, a gay employee of Clayton County, in the Atlanta suburbs. Bostock claimed he was fired in 2013 because he is gay. The county argues that Bostock was let go because of the results of an audit of funds he managed. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Bostock’s claim in a three-page opinion that noted the court was bound by a 1979 decision that held “discharge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII.” Aimee Stephens lost her job as a funeral director in the Detroit area after she revealed to her boss that she had struggled with gender most of her life and had, at long last, “decided to become the person that my mind already is.” Stephens told funeral home owner Thomas Rost that following a vacation, she would report to work wearing a conservative skirt suit or dress that Rost required for women who worked at his three funeral homes. Rost fired Stephens. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio, ruled that the firing constituted sex discrimination under federal law. Stephens died last month.

The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, argued that new Magnitsky-style legislation should be introduced by the government and used against any officials involved in human rights abuses. “There’s one thing that the government could do in relation to helping the Uighur people at the moment and that is to freeze the assets of any of the Chinese officials involved in those human rights abuses over in China,” she told Sky News. “We’ve got new legislation now; we’ve been pushing the government to do that for two years. The UK should not be a haven for people who abuse human rights overseas.” But her government counterpart, Dominic Raab, said sanctions could not just be applied “willy-nilly” and that an evidence base had to be built up to identify those responsible. On 6 July, the government announced its first wave of asset freezes under the new legislation, targeting 25 Russian nationals, 20 Saudi nationals, two Burmese military generals and two organisations with links to North Korean forced labour camps. However, Chinese officials were notable by their absence from the list, despite growing concerns about repression by authorities in Xinjiang. Downing Street also has concerns about China’s involvement in UK infrastructure, such as its nascent 5G telecommunications network. Human rights groups say recent Chinese policy in the long-running conflict with the Muslim minority in Xinjiang has involved mass surveillance and the incarceration without trial of over one million people in “re-education camps”. There are reports that the camps are being used for forced labour. China says its policies are in response to political extremism and the threat of terrorism. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said: “The images we have seen in recent days are harrowing and inhuman. The government has a duty to take a lead and do all we can to save the Uighur people. “We must be clear what is happening here. The Chinese government is engineering a genocide. The foreign secretary must come before MPs before the recess and set out what urgent actions the government will take, both on an international level and unilaterally.” Speaking on the same programme as Ms Nandy, Mr Raab said of the UK’s relationship with China: “I think we need to be very careful in our dealings. On the one hand we want a positive relationship with China – there are all sorts of areas and scope for cooperation, not least on investment and trade and things like that, but also on climate change. “Equally, with various efforts – cyberattacks, the resilience of our vital interests like 5G – and when it comes to standing up for our values as we’ve done very clearly on Hong Kong ... we will always make clear our position on those key interests and values to China. That’s the calibrated approach we’ll take.” Mr Raab said “there won’t be business as usual” and the UK would be “clear-eyed” in its dealings. He told the BBC that it was clear there were ”gross, egregious human rights abuses” being perpetrated against the Uighur people. “We are working with our international partners on this. It is deeply, deeply troubling,” he said. “The reports of the human aspect of it – from forced sterilisation to the education camps – are reminiscent of something we have not seen for a long, long time. “This is from a leading member of the international community that wants to be taken seriously and in fact who we want a positive relationship with. But we cannot see behaviour like that and not call it out.” On the issue of sanctions, he said: “It’s not quite right as Lisa Nandy suggested that you can just willy-nilly decide to sanction X or Y. You have to, as we have done with Magnitsky, with the Rohingya, with North Korea, build up an evidence base and that takes a long time to do because you have to identify accurately and responsibly those involved.” Mr Raab said he would be making a Commons statement on Monday in relation to what further measures the UK would take following China’s imposition of a new national security law in Hong Kong. China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said any measures to sanction officials would be met with a response. “We never believe in unilateral sanctions. We believe the UN is the authority, has the authority to impose sanctions. If the UK government goes that far to impose sanctions on any individuals in China, China will certainly make a resolute response to it,” he told the BBC.

I do not want to see this tit-for-tat in UK relations. I think the UK should have its own independent foreign policy rather than the dance to the tune of Americans like what happened to Huawei.” On the issue of Uighur persecution, the ambassador told the broadcaster: “The so-called western intelligence agencies keep making up this false accusation against China, that 1 million Uighurs have been persecuted. You know how many population Xinjiang has? Forty years ago it was four or five million. Now its 11 million people – and people say we impose ethnic cleansing, but the population had doubled in 40 years. Responding to questions about forced sterilisation, he said: “I can easily refute this accusation. There’s some small group of anti-China elements working against the interests of China, but the majority of people in Xinjiang are happy with what is going on. In the past three years, there’s been not a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang. “People can enjoy a harmonious life. Uighur people enjoy peaceful, harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups of people. The Uighur people is just one small portion of the Chinese population even among the Muslims – but the majority of them are living happily and peacefully with other ethnic [groups]. The success of China is we have a very successful ethnic policy; we treat every ethnic group as an equal.” Speaking on other issues, Ms Nandy said her party had “got it wrong” in its earlier response to concerns about the Russian government. “By prevaricating about issues like [the poisoning in] Salisbury, we let the Tories off the hook. I strongly believe that that has to change and that we have to have a much more strategic approach to Russia,” she said.

The 30-page suit, filed in New York Supreme Court, alleged that NBC created a discriminatory working environment and then fired Roenick “because of his sex and sexual orientation.” The suit also accused NBC of discriminating against Roenick, 50, on the basis of his politics. Roenick is an outspoken supporter of President Trump. In a podcast appearance in December, Roenick said he would like to “go to bed” with his wife and Kathryn Tappen, who hosts NBC’s hockey coverage. “If it really came to fruition, that would really be good, but it’s never going to happen,” Roenick said. After Roenick’s comments, Tappen said in a statement that she remained friends with him, but the threesome remark was “unacceptable.” NBC promptly suspended Roenick. After more than a month in the penalty box, he was sacked in February. The suit accused NBC of breach of contract and violation of New York State human rights law. Roenick was “subjected to repeated unequal treatment, harassment and ultimately terminated based on his membership in protected classes,” the filing said. Roenick played in the NHL from 1988 to 2009.

5626,https://fullertonobserver.com/2020/07/27/a-brief-history-of-housing-discrimination-in-fullerton-and-north-orange-county/,A Brief History of Housing Discrimination in Fullerton and North Orange County - Fullerton Observer,"Recently, I wrote a column about Doss v. Bernal (1943), an important historic housing discrimination case in Fullerton involving the Bernal family. Mexican American families like the Bernals weren’t the only ones who faced housing discrimination in Fullerton, however. Other families in Fullerton also faced the same types of housing discrimination that Mexican Americans did. According to Rusty Kennedy, who was the director of the Orange County Human Relations Commission for many years, “Many of the deeds in Orange County included prohibitions against Blacks, Latinx, Asians and Native Americans, permitting them only if they were gardeners, servants, or nannies…sad but true.” Growing up in Fullerton, Rusty first became involved with social issues due in part to his parents’ social justice activism. When he was a little kid, his parents would hold meetings at their house on social justice issues such as housing discrimination, racism, and farmworker rights. Rusty wrote via email, “I would sit around the back of these meetings and was fascinated to hear what they spoke of. Although I don’t remember, when I was a toddler, my mom went door-to-door in our Golden Hills neighborhood to get petitions signed to advocate the sale of a house up the street to the first Chinese American family in Fullerton, the Chins. At that time in the ‘50s, Blacks, Latinx, and Asians all faced discrimination in housing.” Kennedy explained that one of the legacies of white privilege that was enjoyed by many in the 1950s and ‘60s was the subsidized loans from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) that enabled “Whites Only” to buy houses. Blacks, Latinx, Asians, and Native Americans were systematically denied housing in white neighborhoods, and denied FHA subsidized loans, creating a legacy of renting, while whites were subsidized by the U.S. government in their purchases of housing, which created a legacy of owning and accumulating equity and wealth. “My parents used that equity to enable all five of their children to buy homes, effectively growing the wealth gap between us and African Americans, Latinx, and Native Americans who paid higher and higher rents and accumulated no equity,” Kennedy said. “My wife and I in turn were able to use our equity to enable all 3 of our kids to purchase homes, increasing that wealth gap.” In order to learn about the stories and experiences of African Americans living in north Orange County in the past, I have been reading through the 2010 book, A Different Shade of Orange: Voices of Orange County, California Black Pioneers by Robert A. Johnson and Charlene M. Riggins (e-mail coph@fullerton.edu to order a copy). Johnson and Riggins wanted to focus on the voices of those who represent the 2% African American population in Orange County. Consisting of 26 local oral histories, A Different Shade of Orange explores the challenges faced by African Americans in their day-to-day lives in a county transitioning from rural to suburban. According to Mary Owens, an African American woman who moved to Fullerton from Los Angeles when she was a child, married into the famous Owens family of athletes, and eventually founded the Leon Owens Foundation to help high school and college students after her husband, Leon Owens, passed away, “The problem with Fullerton was housing. That was the real problem.” According to the authors of the book, “Not only were Black people prevented from living in ‘sundown towns’ like Brea and Orange and prevented from purchasing property in areas that had racial covenants like the land that Richard Nixon’s father bought in Yorba Linda, it was almost impossible to find any apartment to rent or property to buy outside of the Truslow area” (185). For much of the 20th century, non-whites were forced to rent or purchase homes south of the railroad tracks, like in the Truslow neighborhood. The term “sundown towns” refers to towns where it was illegal for Black people to be there after sundown. For a lot of years, with the exception of the Truslow neighborhood, Fullerton was basically a sundown town. The historical reality of sundown towns is comprehensively documented in James Lowen’s 2005 book, Sundown Towns. There were widespread racist civic and housing policies throughout Orange County, including Fullerton. In this city, the only neighborhood where minorities were allowed to rent or own homes was on the south side of the train tracks. Mary Owens recalled in A Different Shade of Orange, “At first, we had gone to look for apartments, and they would not rent to us. Leon [her husband] said, ‘You know, we’re going to have to buy a house here.’ That’s what happened. We bought a house, this house [on Truslow].” Warren Bussey, an African American man who moved to Fullerton during the early 1950s, told a similar story. “We were only living on two blocks…Living in California at that time, it was more prejudiced than it was in Texas,” Bussey said. By the 1970s, there were no longer sundown towns. As jobs opened up and fair housing laws were created and enforced, more Black families moved into homes and apartments throughout Orange County. However, this development occurred in spite of the fact that discrimination in buying and renting was still the rule and not the exception. Those African Americans who wanted to live in the Orange County suburbs could find housing if they had the patience and the resources to keep trying and not give up when lied to or told they were not wanted. Often times, the move into a house or apartment required support from both Black people and White people as well as fair-housing organizations. The OC Human Relations Commission was created in 1971 by advocates for civil rights who were upset with police brutality against Latinos, housing discrimination, lack of affordable health care, and discrimination in education. This official County Commission was seen as a vehicle for eliminating prejudice, intolerance, and discrimination based on race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, socio-economic status, and age. “Initially housing discrimination was acted on with individual cases being set up and litigation, or the threat of litigation reversing it,” wrote Rusty Kennedy via email. “The Fair Housing Council was the non-profit organization that conducted that case-by-case approach. Ultimately, it became evident that a more insidious form of discrimination was being practiced and a more sophisticated approach would be required to undermine it.” Interestingly enough, my grandpa, Lawrence Little, served as chairman of the Anaheim Fair Housing Council in 1964. “When an African American was rejected from renting an apartment, they were usually told it was already rented, so we would send a White person out later to the same apartment building and, usually, they were able to rent that apartment,” my grandpa said. “That told us that they were being discriminated against, which meant we had a case. We would write and threaten the owners with a lawsuit unless they rented to the African American people.” City Councils and the predominantly White middle-class residents who elected them opposed the construction of affordable housing, causing low-income individuals to commute from neighboring counties. The OC Human Relations Commission, Fair Housing Council, League of Women Voters, Legal Aid Society and other housing advocates formed the Housing Coalition to advocate for the development of Affordable Housing. Policies were passed in some cities and the County to require inclusion of a percentage of affordable housing in all new developments. Density bonuses were given to make it more profitable for developers to build low-cost housing. State legislation was passed, requiring that all cities develop Housing Elements in their zoning and master plans to include adequate affordable housing to meet the Regional Housing Needs Assessment goals for low-cost housing. Rusty Kennedy said, “Lawsuits were initiated against cities such as Newport Beach, Santa Ana, Irvine, and others that refused to include affordable housing in their plans. The settlements were then used to start non-profit affordable housing organizations that continue today, such as the Civic Center Housing Corporation, the OC Community Housing Corporation, and Irvine Housing Opportunities. These non-profits and the litigation settlements that created them were conceived by Fullerton’s Ralph Kennedy [Rusty Kennedy’s father], who founded the Fullerton Observer.” When asked what he would consider the OC Human Relations Commission’s biggest victory against discrimination, Rusty Kennedy pointed to the Hate Crime Network, which was started in 1991. It was a unique collaboration that brought traditionally hostile parties together around a shared mission to eliminate hate crime. He explained that representatives from African American, Latinx, Asian, LGBTQ, Jewish, and Muslim communities, as well as the police, came together at the invitation of the Commission. Based on trusting relationships developed with all these communities, the Commission started a collaboration that continues today, building relationships between police and these diverse communities. “We had to overcome intergroup animosities as well, some groups holding intolerant views of others,” Kennedy said. “But we brought them together to document hate crime, collaborate to get effective reporting of hate crime, and educate each community and the police about the special nature of hate crime. Even as some say that it is divisive to report hate crime as it makes Orange County look bad, the Hate Crime Network facilitated by OC Human Relations continues to stand up for victims of hate and put their stories on the front pages of the media.” It’s important to understand what happened in history so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes in the present. ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— Protect local journalism – please subscribe to the print edition of the Fullerton Observer.

I have a disabling mental health issue. If you think we don’t face similar discrimination, you have forgotten that this is the city in which a homeless, mentally-ill man was beaten to death for no other reason than being in a ” protected” class. It would be nice to stop seeing only discrimination that affects your personal.agenda and include all protected classes. We are far from anything close to being free from painful discrimination regarding housing or anything else when it comes to the disabled and homeless. I made comment about the horrible conditions of the shelters and spreading of COVID as someone said get COVID and die! I raised my family here, got my degree and became disabled.

Good Subscriber Account active since The US Defense Department enacted sweeping plans to address gaps in ""diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunities"" for all the military branches, changes that come in the wake of social unrest following the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement across the country. ""The purpose of this approach is to promote the morale, cohesion, and readiness of the force,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a memo dated Tuesday. ""Each effort aims to identify actions the Department can take within policies, programs, and processes to improve diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity for our service members."" ""As a military, we succeed by working together, hand in hand, side by side,"" the memo added. ""Diversity and inclusivity in the ranks are not merely aspirations, they are fundamental necessities to our readiness and our mission success."" The cultural reckoning unfolding across the US has prompted veterans to come forward to report their own abuse. West Point cadets said they felt ""shunned"" for reporting racism. And women veterans have described being sexually harassed in the wake of news that a 20-year-old Army specialist was killed by a fellow soldier, according to Army investigators. The actions in the memo are outlined in three separate initiatives — a ""short-term 'sprint' for immediate actions,"" the creation of a diversity and inclusion board to ""dive deeply into our policies,"" and the formation of a longer-term advisory committee ""to provide an independent and enduring review and assessment that will strengthen our efforts in this area for generations to come."" The initiative, parts of which were already expected to go into effect, will ban photographs from a service member's promotion packet starting in September. US service members often submit a dossier of their personal information to a board of senior members for promotion consideration, information that includes their physical fitness scores; aptitude in their respective jobs; and a photograph of them in uniform. ""The prejudice and bias that exist within our force are not always transparent,"" the memo said, adding that the Defense Department will use additional surveys throughout the military to look for ""harassment and discrimination, extremist groups and activities."" The memo also stated the military was planning to implement additional training to address: Many Black women in the military have long demanded changes to hair standards that were discriminatory — braids and ponytails were banned in the US Navy until 2018 and Black women were not allowed to wear their natural hair. The changes come as the military explores other avenues to curb symbols that evoke racial tension. The Defense Department has enacted several panels to investigate the effects of Confederate symbols, such as the Confederate flag and the names of US Army bases, within the military. Both the US Navy and the Marine Corps have issued directives to ban the Confederate flag on all of its installations. House lawmakers are also attempting to allocate $1 million in a defense spending bill to rename US Army bases that honor Confederate leaders during the Civil War. The total $695 billion bill, one of a dozen scheduled to be considered by House Appropriations subcommittees, includes provisions that would allocate the funds ""for expenses for the renaming of Army installations, facilities, roads, and streets named after confederate leaders and officers.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5657,https://www.hockeyfeed.com/nhl-news/jeremy-roenick-accuses-nbc-of-discrimination-in-potentially-damaging-lawsuit,Jeremy Roenick accuses NBC of discrimination in potentially damaging lawsuit.,"One of the National Hockey League's most controversial stars once again finds himself at the center of controversy, although this time it is in an arena that he is considerably less familiar with. According to a recent report from Variety's Gene Maddus, Roenick has filed a lawsuit against his former employer in NBC Sports alleging that the company discriminated against him when they fired him. For those of you who have not followed this story, Roenick was suspended and eventually fired after he made some rather graphic comments about his wife and her friend, Kathryn Tappen, while he was featured on Barstool Sports' Spittin Chiclets podcast. I won't repeat the comments here but Roenick spoke about parts of her body and described fantasizing about the possibility of bringing Tappen into he and his wife's bedroom. Tappen, although clearly a friend of the family, is Roenick's colleague at NBC Sports and was understandably uncomfortable with the rather sexual comments made by one of her colleagues. NBC made the decision to suspend Roenick from their broadcast at the time of the incident and has since fired him, leading to this current lawsuit. According to Roenick however the company discriminated against him by allowing other employees to make similar comments directly on an NBC broadcast while firing him for his comments that were admittedly on a different platform entirely. Roenick specifically cites incidents involving NBC commentators Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir in which they make comments describing body parts in a similar fashion and even make an insinuation of an affair involving one of the competitors they were commenting on at the time. That in and of itself seems like a pretty weak argument but Roenick claims to have discussed this privately at NBC with his supervisor Sam Flood, and this is where things get disturbing. Roenick claims he pointed out the hypocrisy to Flood only to have Flood then claim that Weir “is gay and can say whatever.” Now I must stress that this is Jeremy Roenick's version of events and has not been proven to be true but if Roenick is indeed telling the truth this would clearly be discrimination based on his sexual preference, something that is obviously frowned upon. Roenick also claims that his support for President Donald Trump may have played a factor with Flood repeatedly rebuking him on this matter. Roenick says that he was told the following when asking for permission to speak at the 2016 Republican National Convention: “I’m not saying what you can do. You know who you work for. You work for NBC. That would not look good on your NBC record.” Roenick also claims that Flood would continue to make derogatory remarks regarding his political beliefs following that incident, remarks like “your boy is messing up this country.” Again I must stress that these are merely claims that have been filled by Jeremy Roenick and have yet to be proven true in a court of law, however if Roenick does indeed have evidence of these claims it could mean a big time lawsuit for NBC and NBC Sports.

5770,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trump-financial-regulator-quietly-shelved-discrimination-probes-into-bank-of-america-and-other-lenders/,Trump financial regulator quietly shelved discrimination probes into Bank of America and other lenders,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. In the spring of 2018, bank regulators trained to spot discriminatory lending detected something alarming at Bank of America. The bank was offering fewer loans to minority homebuyers in Philadelphia than to white people in a way that troubled examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, according to two people directly involved in the probe and internal documents reviewed by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum. The officials suspected the second-largest bank in the United States was “redlining,” or deliberately turning its back on minority homebuyers, the people said. But after complaints from Bank of America, the OCC’s investigation stalled by September 2018. The OCC, which is part of the U.S. Treasury Department, never sanctioned the bank. The abandoned Bank of America inquiry is part of a larger, previously unreported pattern in which the Trump administration has pulled back on civil rights enforcement as a part of its overall relaxation of bank oversight. Since President Donald Trump took office, the OCC has quietly shelved at least six investigations of discrimination and redlining, according to internal agency documents and eight people familiar with the cases. Flagstar Bank, a leading lender in Michigan, wrongly charged Black homeowners more through a network of mortgage lending affiliates, OCC officials concluded in 2017. That same year, agency examiners found that Colorado Federal Bank, an online lender, was doing the same to female borrowers. Another inquiry by OCC officials concluded that Chicago-based MB Financial, a lender acquired by Fifth Third Bank last year, charged Latinos too much on mortgage loans. Cadence Bank, a lender in several Southern states, was turning away minority borrowers in Houston, according to an OCC investigation. Fulton Bank, a lender based in Pennsylvania, had been discriminating against minorities in parts of Richmond, Virginia, and its home state, regulators concluded. In each case, despite staff recommendations that fines or other penalties be imposed, the OCC took no public action and closed the investigations quietly. In the past, banks have had to pay substantial sums after similar investigations. In 2012, in the wake of the housing crisis, Wells Fargo paid $175 million to resolve allegations that it charged Blacks and Hispanics more to buy a home after an investigation that began with the OCC years earlier. Each of the banks declined to comment on the specifics of the investigations and said they are committed to providing equal access to credit. The OCC has historically prioritized the well-being of banks over bank customers, said current and former examiners, but the balance has shifted even further under the Trump administration. “We have not always been the biggest defender of consumers,” said one veteran OCC attorney who has handled enforcement matters but asked not to be named for fear of losing his job. “Lately, though, we are outright hostile.” Career staff and ordinary agency employees who have raised alarms about discrimination and other consumer abuses have seen their concerns brushed aside by the agency’s leadership, according to two current and two former OCC officials who have left in the last three years. The OCC was run from November 2017 until May of this year by Joseph Otting, a former bank executive with ties to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The administration has not only held back from redlining enforcement but tinkered with rules for applying the Community Reinvestment Act, a law that has helped combat discrimination for five decades. Homeownership remains a key path to building family wealth in America, but the homeownership rate among blacks is 44 percent compared to whites at 74 percent, according to the most recent census data. One major obstacle to narrowing that gap is discrimination in mortgage lending. A 2019 study by the Consumer Financial Bureau found that white borrowers are more likely to get a home loan than Black borrowers with the same credit score. Yet in June 2018, as OCC examiners on the ground in Philadelphia scanned loan records and interviewed Bank of America employees to detect discrimination on mortgages, Otting testified before Congress that he had never seen racial bias in banking. “I have not personally observed that,” Otting told the House Financial Services Committee, stunning lawmakers with a statement that he tried to walk back a day later, telling the Senate Banking Committee that “there’s lots of evidence of inequity in the world.” Brian Brooks, a former bank executive who has led the OCC on an interim basis since Otting stepped down in May, said recently that public enforcement actions were of limited value in addressing the “root cause” of banking discrimination. “The root cause is not going to be solved by bringing an enforcement action against some small bank,” Brooks told Politico. In a statement to ProPublica, Brooks said: “I will not comment on decisions and actions that preceded me, but under my leadership the OCC will use all our tools as warranted to ensure everyone has fair access to banking services and receives fair treatment from the banks and savings associations the OCC oversees.” The OCC is the grandaddy of banking regulators, conceived under Abraham Lincoln to make sure banks were safe and sound, and it has a unique role in fighting discrimination. The OCC is responsible for checking that national banks comply with the landmark Fair Housing Act of 1968, which banned redlining. The agency also has a key role enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to lend in poor neighborhoods and grades banks on how well they meet the goals of the law. Otting spent much of his two and a half years in office rewriting the rules for the CRA, and he stepped down the day after he unveiled a reform plan that gives banks more flexibility in satisfying the law. In a different era, regulators and law enforcement worked together to try to stamp out racial bias. Eight federal agencies have a role in policing discrimination in the marketplace, and all are required to inform the Justice Department when they see it. The Justice Department received 22 fair lending referrals from a variety of agencies in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last year in office. In 2018, under Trump, the Justice Department received four referrals, according to the latest Justice report. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has made a large share of fair lending referrals since the agency was created in 2010. During the Obama administration, the OCC made six referrals and worked closely with the CFPB on other fair lending cases, said Richard Cordray, the first CFPB chief. “There was just a lot more cooperation and a lot more interest in taking on banks to protect consumers,” Cordray said of the Obama years. “That has changed dramatically.” As Otting downplayed racial discrimination in his congressional testimony, his examiners in Philadelphia saw enough troubling data to take the next step in the probe. Officials involved in the Bank of America matter declined to say exactly what raised alarms except that it was rooted in data they saw about the price and availability of home loans. OCC examiners can see information such as customer credit scores and the costs associated with a loan. Overall in the city, African-Americans are disproportionately denied when they seek to purchase homes, according to reporting by Reveal. The examiners brought in OCC lawyers who were trained to tell when a bank’s lending practices could be deemed discriminatory, according to two people involved in the Bank of America matter. Bringing OCC lawyers into an exam often signals that the agency is moving toward an enforcement action, said former examiners. When the OCC brought in its lawyers, Bank of America bristled. Bank of America’s chief counsel’s office insisted that its own attorneys be in the room if OCC examiners wanted to keep talking to its employees. The OCC exam manual explicitly discourages such involvement. When conducting investigations, OCC examiners should generally resist allowing a bank’s lawyers to be part of a routine exam since that “may be an unacceptable restriction on the examiner’s access to information,” according to portions of the exam manual seen by ProPublica. As a routine exam becomes a deeper probe, the agency should allow examiners to finish their work to build a case, said the former examiners, who declined to be named since they still have professional dealings with the OCC. A bank’s lawyers would typically become involved in the later stages of an investigation if OCC examiners believed they had found wrongdoing, several former examiners said. Nevertheless, Morris Morgan, the OCC’s head of large bank supervision, who had previously been the regulator’s top examiner overseeing Bank of America, agreed to the bank’s request to have its lawyers sit in early on the probe. The OCC then took another step that potentially helped Bank of America. The agency assigned a separate team of OCC lawyers to scrutinize the whole Bank of America probe — an unusual step considering that the exam was still ongoing and that such a move could chill an investigation, said the two former examiners. Moreover, said two officials involved in the probe, the OCC never fully engaged the expert economists, statisticians and other specialists of the agency’s Risk Analysis Division who are trained to spot patterns of abuse among hundreds of thousands of mortgage loans and who can help build a case against a bank. Within the OCC, one step below the Comptroller is the Major Matters Supervision Review Committee, a panel that decides the most sensitive enforcement issues at the agency. Fair housing matters are typically decided by this committee, which is largely staffed by officials who report to the Comptroller. It’s not clear if Otting himself weighed in on the case. Otting did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment. The Bank of America probe was not brought before the committee. By September 2018, the OCC had killed the Bank of America probe. The OCC did not bring any sanctions against the bank. The matter was shelved before examiners could decide if their first suspicions about Bank of America had merit, according to the two officials involved who said the agency’s investigation was halted before it could finish. The OCC and Morgan both declined to comment on the Bank of America redlining matter, which involves confidential supervisory work. David Leitch, Bank of America’s chief counsel, declined to comment. Bank of America also declined to comment on the investigation but said: “We are committed to fairly and responsibly meeting the credit needs of our clients and to complying fully with the letter and spirit of fair lending laws, regulations and principles.” A spokesman also pointed to a recent Bank of America statement that the lender has earmarked $1 billion in future corporate gifts and loans to help local communities fight inequality. The bank is still finalizing details of the plan. In 2018, as OCC examiners in Philadelphia were looking at Bank of America, a separate team of examiners looking at loans in Texas spotted abuse at Cadence Bancorp, a regional lender based in Houston. Cadence was making minority borrowers pass a wealth threshold that white customers did not have to meet when they borrowed against the equity in their home in second-lien or “piggyback” mortgages, according to OCC documents reviewed by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum. Examiners opened a formal investigation and pushed its findings through several internal reviews for most of 2018. The bank said any unequal treatment was accidental, but OCC experts did not find that credible. Experts within the Risk Analysis Division endorsed the Cadence findings. In controversial cases, the OCC gets a second opinion from its independent ombudsman, Larry Hattix, who backed the OCC staffers. In December 2018, the OCC referred the redlining matter to the Justice Department as a civil rights concern. By early last year, the Justice Department had decided against taking action. It sent the matter back to the OCC but said the agency could use its own power to sanction the bank, according to a Justice Department spokesman. “It is not unusual that we defer to the financial regulators,” said the spokesman. “Deferral may be appropriate, for example, when the lender has self-identified the problem, changed its policies, and compensated any affected borrowers.” But OCC officials reporting to Otting decided last year not to publicly sanction Cadence, according to OCC documents and two people with direct knowledge of the matter. In a statement, Cadence said that it could not comment on its dealings with the OCC but that it stopped offering piggyback mortgage loans last year and that the bank never discriminated. “Cadence Bank does — and always has — treated minority consumers in a fair and non-discriminatory manner and is always looking for ways we can do better,” the bank said. In another investigation, OCC examiners scrutinized home loans at MB Financial, a lender based in Illinois, and found that Latinos and women were not being offered discount mortgages as often as white men, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. This looked like deliberate bias, examiners determined after reviewing loan records, and by late 2018 economists at the OCC Risk Analysis Division agreed, as did Hattix, the agency’s ombudsman. The OCC referred the matter to the Justice Department as a discrimination case, but the DOJ, under Attorney General William Barr, sent it back, according to two people involved in the matter. If bank regulators wanted to punish MB Financial, they would have to do it themselves. In the end, the OCC did nothing. MB Financial was bought by Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio lender, and essentially slipped out of OCC jurisdiction. The OCC notified the Federal Reserve, which oversees Fifth Third, about what it found at MB Financial. The Fed has the ability to block mergers if it sees wrongdoing but it allowed the MB Financial deal to go ahead. “Discrimination has no place in our society and the Fed takes these issues seriously in its role overseeing banking organizations,” a Fed spokesman said. “However, the Fed does not have direct supervisory authority over all banks.” In a statement, Fifth Third said: “The intent of Fifth Third is to be in full compliance with all fair lending regulations. MB Financial had a similar intent.” Two of the scuttled redlining investigations involved banks that use outside agents to originate a significant portion of their mortgage loans. The OCC found that agents working for Flagstar Bank of Michigan were charging Black homebuyers more than whites and Colorado Federal, an online lender, was charging women more than men, according to two people involved in the matters. Both cases had come to light during the Trump administration, and both were dropped without a public enforcement action. Flagstar Bank declined to comment for this story. Colorado Federal did not respond to several requests for comment. Regulators fall short if they turn a blind eye to discrimination or only issue quiet reprimands and private wrist-slaps when they find abuses, said Jeremy Kress, a former Federal Reserve attorney. “Banks are less likely to misbehave if they think they are going to be called out for wrongdoing,” he said. “We can’t rely on regulators to do their job in secret, as recent scandals have shown.” Filed under:    So do we.

5814,http://theconversation.com/dvla-u-turn-over-autistic-drivers-highlights-the-ongoing-issue-of-autism-discrimination-113051,DVLA U-turn over autistic drivers highlights the ongoing issue of autism discrimination,"Professor of Inclusive Practice, Sheffield Hallam University Nick Hodge does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  Sheffield Hallam University provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Without consultation or warning, the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) recently changed its website guidance for drivers with an autistic spectrum disorder. It stated that such drivers need to declare to the DVLA that they are autistic regardless of whether or not this affects their driving. And with no publicity for the change, this immediately put many autistic drivers in the position of unknowingly breaking the law by continuing to drive. The change required autistic drivers to complete a form and detail levels of alcohol and drug use, name their doctor and specialist consultant, as well as what clinics they attend and when. Drivers also had to agree to these medical professionals being contacted for information – even though their doctor’s specific understanding of what it means to be autistic might be limited. The declaration also meant that autistic drivers had to prove they were fit to drive or face a £1,000 fine and possible prosecution in the event of an accident – and in some instances have their licence revoked. But thankfully, a successful challenge to the DVLA over the practice of treating autistic drivers differently was launched and the decision was overturned. The challenge centred on the idea that the requirement of disclosure is against the human rights of autistic people as it treats them differently. But herein lies part of the problem, because it is the autistic community and its allies that have promoted this very idea of autistic people being different. Many people, the DVLA included, use the term autistic spectrum disorder. It is unsurprising, then, that this raises questions about whether people who are considered to be “disordered” are safe to drive on the roads. Autistic people and their supporters challenge the use of the term “disorder”, claiming it to be misleading, demeaning and an attack on self-esteem. Instead, many autistic self-advocates identify as “different” rather than “disordered”. The National Autistic Society (NAS) supports this notion of difference but also refers to autism as a “condition”. But for autistic drivers, this is probably no more helpful than the term “disorder”, as the DVLA is as likely to be concerned about people driving with a “condition” as a “disorder”. Nor will the idea of being “different” be of any more help to autistic drivers – as it is not clear who or what autistics are different from. Difference therefore becomes just another term that marginalises autistic people. It sets them apart as “other” and makes them vulnerable to particular regulation. My own research has long been concerned with how this notion of difference has the potential to take those who identify as autistic outside of being human. In doing so, people who identify as autistic are then left without the protection of rights that are the entitlement of all human beings. Fortunately, the DVLA has made a U-turn in this case and now drivers only have to declare that they are autistic if this will impede their driving. But this lucky escape should be a warning to us all to think more carefully about claiming difference. I worry, though, that this regulation change from the DVLA is just one example of how being different can lead to being treated differently. The panic that has resulted from this action of the DVLA clearly demonstrates how devastating the effects of being denied the protection of human rights can be. It is time we moved way from celebrating and promoting this concept of difference. We need instead to assert the humanity of people who identify as, or have been categorised as, autistic. This will involve the identification and celebration of the qualities and contributions that all its members bring to society as well as recognising the challenges and barriers they face. We should, of course, highlight and protest against physical and social environments when they are constructed in ways that disable some people. But this happens because society often only considers the needs of some, rather than all, of its members. It is not because some beings are essentially and distinctly different. Along with the concepts of “disorder” and “condition”, the action of the DVLA has highlighted how “difference” can be an equally dangerous road to take.

5934,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/mundelein/ct-mun-mhs-to-enact-anti-discrimination-policies-tl-0730-20200728-minmx5ueijbqvnce5hxen3dquu-story.html,"Mundelein High School planning audit to address inequity, discrimination within district","At a recent rally hosted by a student organization, Mundelein High School officials announced various policies they will take going forward to address any discrimination, racism or inequity within the school. Those policies broadly speaking include an equity audit designed to look into various school codes, outcomes, data and policies to see where inequity exists. Officials also spoke about looking into hiring practices and opening more lines of communications with minority groups and individuals. But these policies are more so a continuation of previous adjustments made by Mundelein High School District 120. Superintendent Kevin Myers, along with Stacey Gorman, the assistant principal of teaching and learning, both of whom spoke at the rally hosted by the school’s Black Student Union, said these efforts have been going on for a couple of years now. “When we go through policy renewal, (the board) asks themselves if this is meeting the needs of all students,” Myers said. Some of this policy has included dress code practices, which Gorman confirmed was disproportionately impacting female students. Myers said the district has also looked at different kinds of opportunities available to the students. This includes analyzing what students do or do not have a pathway to accelerated course work, and trying to figure out why this is. Gorman elaborated on this topic, and said they have some preliminary information that shows a lack of diversity in accelerated courses. Gorman said the district has met with Black and Brown students to see why they are not enrolling. She said a lot of the feedback she has gotten comes down to their friends not being in those classes, or they don’t feel comfortable because they don’t know anybody, or they’ve heard it’s hard. “When you look at the grades and test scores of many of our Brown and Black students, they should be taking accelerated courses,” Gorman said. In response, the district has created an “Earned Honors Program” in their social studies department for freshmen. This program allows students who demonstrate abilities beyond their grade level to earn honors credit. Gorman said they’ve found when Black and Brown students earn honors credits, they move on to accelerated course work in their following years, which she said has led to an increase in diversity within those classes. “We are committed to expanding that earned honors model to other departments as well,” she said. Myers said in terms of environment, the district has looked at ways to be more inclusive and inviting to their Black and Brown students. He said sometimes it has come down to things as simple as signage and the language being used. The district has also begun various practices, Gorman said. The district has taken steps to try and create communication between them and minority families. This has included hiring a parent liaison, who also is a member of the Latinx community. Policies and practices like this have also included little shifts in approach. Gorman gave an example regarding Latinx families and their needs. “Rather than asking our Latinx families to come to us, we’ll go to you,” Gorman said. “We went . . . to their homes and it was amazing . . . We sat in a casual environment and listened to their concerns and shared important information with them.” In trying to open more communication, the district has also hosted many focus groups to help get input from their Black and Brown students. She added the virtual shift has allowed for a lot of opportunity in this area, allowing for video chats with students, parents and administration. The equity audit is being made a priority this upcoming school year, Myers said. He added the current focus at this time is getting the school reopened and set up for the new year. But he anticipates starting the audit during the first semester. The audit would analyze the practices of the district, the data in terms of achievement level or types of classes being taken, the opportunities available across the board and what students are taking advantage of those opportunities. “I don’t know how long that takes,” Myers said. “I think for us, the sooner we get the information, the sooner we can start planning ahead.” Gorman also spoke about a program, titled “Mundelein United” that the district is participating in. This is a partnership with District 75 and various local organizations, including the Mundelein Parks District and the Mano a Mano Family Resource Center in Lake County. The purpose of the program is to encourage work and conversations between the organizations to figure out how each organization individually can improve their policies and procedures to increase equity. At the rally hosted by the Black Student Union, a couple of students spoke out specifically against various procedures or incidents that have happened to them or friends at MHS. Myers said hearing what the students had to say was hard, but the school is looking to use those critiques to make their system better, calling this an opportunity to learn. “As an educator, we’re here to educate our students and provide them a safe and secure environment,” he said. “Hearing our students say (that), it really hurts to the core. I’ll also say I’m so proud of our students for being able to speak up and say that because if we’re willing to listen, we have an opportunity to learn and not have our students experience that again.” CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group that represents northern First Nations is sounding the alarm after two alleged incidents of racial discrimination by security at the Thompson Walmart in less than a week. Hey there, time traveller! This article was published 3/7/2020 (402 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current. The group that represents northern First Nations is sounding the alarm after two alleged incidents of racial discrimination by security at the Thompson Walmart in less than a week. Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak Grand Chief Garrison Settee said his group received several complaints from Indigenous people who said they had been racially profiled while trying to enter the store or while shopping at it. ""It’s appalling that we still have to deal with this, especially in our north… we contribute to the economy, we contribute to the overall expansion of Thompson,"" he said. ""For our people to be subject to this kind of racial profiling is unacceptable."" MKO wants a meeting with Walmart Canada to discuss the incidents. Alister Weenusk Jr., an Indigenous man, went to the Walmart with his wife on Thursday to pick up water and supplies. Weenusk said they both wore sunglasses, and despite many other people entering at the same time wearing sunglasses, they were approached by a security guard and told to remove their sunglasses so the guard could check to see if they had been drinking. ""I refused and told him you’re profiling us. He denied it and threatened to call the cops,"" Weenusk said. He felt ""embarrassed and humiliated."" He complained to a manager, but he said he has yet to hear back. He said he will attend a peaceful protest against racial profiling that was scheduled for Friday evening outside Walmart. Weenusk and his wife live in Oxford House and pay $1,000 to fly to Thompson and stock up on necessities. Weenusk said he felt unsafe when he returned to shop on Friday. ""I was scared of being attacked again. I didn’t want to be embarrassed again,"" he said. A spokesperson for Walmart Canada said the chain had been made aware of the incident and the company ""is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for our associates and our customers."" Earlier in the week, Wayne Constant, also an Indigenous man, said a security guard prevented him from entering the store because, according to Constant, the security guard said he looked like ""one of the drunks."" ""He labeled me as a drunk on the street, not a human being… it makes you feel pretty down, when somebody stigmatizes you with that label,"" he said. Constant, who has lived in Thompson for 35 years, said it was not the first time someone in his family had been profiled at the Walmart store. On one occasion, his wife was questioned when she bought mouthwash. Get the day’s breaking stories, weather forecast, and more sent straight to your inbox every morning. ""It hurts a lot when a person says, ‘You’re nothing but a drunk, you don’t belong in this society.’ It took me back to residential schools,"" he said. He said he will file a human rights complaint against Walmart and will seek guidance from MKO and an expert in racial discrimination. Constant echoed Weenusk’s concerns about returning to the Walmart. Despite his mistreatment, he said it would be impractical to boycott the chain. ""We only have one Walmart in Thompson, and we have limited supplies in Thompson,"" he said.

5954,https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/will-trump-policy-save-the-suburbs/,Will Trump Save the Suburbs By Cutting a Rule To Stop Discrimination?,"(RoschetzkyIstockPhoto/Getty Images) Earlier this year, President Donald Trump did away with a little-known rule created to prevent racial discrimination in housing that he claimed was having “a devastating impact” on America’s suburbs. Just four months before the presidential election, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it will end the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulation. The rule, introduced by President Barack Obama‘s administration in 2015, was a provision of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Its aim was to force cities receiving federal housing money to assess and then address local housing discrimination.  “At the request of many great Americans who live in the Suburbs, and others, I am studying the AFFH housing regulation that is having a devastating impact on these once thriving Suburban areas,” Trump tweeted on June 30. The president has accused his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, of wanting to “abolish” the suburbs. Biden supports the regulation. HUD called the AFFH “complicated, costly and ineffective” in a press release issued Thursday. “We found it to be unworkable and ultimately a waste of time for localities to comply with, too often resulting in funds being steered away from communities that need them most,” HUD Secretary Ben Carson said in a statement. “Washington has no business dictating what is best to meet your local community’s unique needs.” ___ Watch: Mortgage Rates, Consumer Confidence, and You, the Home Buyer ___ The original rule, if it had been left in place, would have likely resulted in communities allowing more affordable housing to go up. It may have also led to zoning changes to allow apartment and condo buildings, as well as smaller, more affordable, single-family homes to be built. This would have affected some wealthier communities that have long fought these developments claiming they could bring down property values. However, AFFH didn’t result in any sweeping changes nationally. The Trump administration took the teeth out of the regulation in 2018 by eliminating the requirement for cities to use the government’s reporting tool and granting them an extra two years to turn in their assessments. This latest move by the administration is just the final nail in the AFFH’s coffin. “This is coming at a time when we’re seeing the heavy price that communities of color pay when we allow segregation and discrimination to happen,” says Peggy Bailey. She is the vice president of housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank. “The impact will be, communities will be allowed to sweep housing discrimination under the rug,” she says. “There will be limited, if no accountability, if communities enact policies that advance segregation and discrimination.” The replacement rule, called Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice, is designed to ensure that housing is “affordable, safe, decent, free of unlawful discrimination and accessible under civil rights laws,” according to the press release. But some see the rule swap as a ploy in the presidential election campaign. Trump “is trying to win back the suburban vote by scaring them and claiming he is up against an opponent who wants to destroy the suburbs through racial and economic integration,” says Evan McKenzie, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “He’s invoking the idea of the suburbs of the past, that were uniformly white and prosperous.” Clare Trapasso is the deputy news editor of Realtor.com.

6031,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/belarus-misogyny-and-discrimination-fuels-vicious-campaign-against-activists-ahead-of-election/,Belarus: Misogyny and discrimination fuels vicious campaign against activists ahead of election,"The Belarusian authorities must halt their crackdown on all dissent ahead of the presidential election on 9 August, and immediately end their vicious campaign of targeting women activists and family members of political opposition representatives using tactics fueled by misogyny, Amnesty International said today. In Crackdown from the Top: Gender-based Reprisals against Women in Belarus, the organization exposes the authorities’ playbook of targeting women with gender-specific reprisals, which include threats to take their children into state custody and threats of sexual violence. “Insatiable in their intention to silence their political opponents and any form of dissent, the Belarusian authorities are wheeling out practices that smack of misogyny. They are deliberately targeting women involved in politics or female family members of political activists, including with open discrimination and threats of sexual violence,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director. “With the election just a month away, women activists not only pose a formidable challenge to the incumbent but also face President Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s openly misogynistic remarks broadcast on prime-time national television. Women also face disproportionate and politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment and reprisals in Belarus today.” Threats to seize children Using the presidential decree which outlines “measures to protect children in disadvantaged families”, the authorities threaten to take children away from women political activists and from families of jailed opposition members. When Vitalia Navumik’s husband – political activist Uladzimir Navumik – was arrested for purported “hooliganism” on 29 May, her flat in Hrodna was searched by police who then filed an unfounded report with the local educational services about “poor living conditions of the child”. Vitalia told Amnesty International: “According to the police, our apartment was messy, with cigarette butts and empty alcohol bottles lying around. Except it wasn’t true and a video made [by police] during the search can prove it. But it was never provided as evidence. “When during the inspection they told me that my daughter could be taken away, I was so horrified that I didn’t even know what to say or how to react. I just stood there in front of them, too shocked to talk.” Threats of sexual violence On at least one occasion, the female partner of a political activist targeted by the authorities was reportedly threatened with gang rape by the police while she was in the police station. Violetta, the partner of Dmitry Lukomsky, was filming the policemen who came to their house looking for him and who then took her to the police station for questioning. She told Amnesty International: “They asked me why I had tried to film their visits to my home and their spying on me and I replied that I had wanted to protect myself. So, one of them said: ‘Well, right now you are not videotaping us and we can all rape you and you won’t be able to prove it’.” Other forms of gender-based discrimination by the authorities against women activists in Belarus include disproportionately heavy fines, and not allowing basic items of personal hygiene such as sanitary towels, for women detained for participation in peaceful rallies. “These deeply disturbing patterns are no doubt fueled by the state-sponsored misogyny so apparent in Belarus ahead of the August election. Political reprisals which seek to spread fear and despair, and those that specifically target women, must end immediately,” said Marie Struthers. Background The presidential election is scheduled to take place on 9 August. Incumbent Alyaksandr Lukashenka is seeking re-election for a sixth consecutive term. His political rivals are facing severe reprisals, and two aspiring presidential candidates, Viktar Babaryka and Syarhei Tsikhanouski, were arbitrarily arrested and are currently remanded as criminal suspects on unfounded charges. The wife of the latter, Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, entered the presidential race instead. She, along with other women political activists, has faced harassment and intimidation. Hundreds of her supporters and supporters of other opposition candidates, as well as other activists, have been arrested and subjected to ill-treatment. Many have been issued with fines or so-called “administrative detention” lasting for days and sometime weeks at a time.

While the headlines have been dominated by the issue of colour discrimination, other forms of prejudice have not escaped notice. Media reports on Tuesday stated technology major Cisco systems was being sued by California regulators. California authorities have accused Cisco of ""discriminating against an Indian-American employee and allowing him to be harassed by two managers because he was from a lower Indian caste than them."" The lawsuit was filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing in a federal court in San Jose, where Cisco has its headquarters. Reuters reported the unnamed victim ""has been a principal engineer at Cisco’s San Jose headquarters since October 2015 and that he was born at the bottom of caste hierarchy as a dalit, once called 'untouchables'"". The two managers accused of discrimination were named as ""former Cisco engineering managers Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella"". They have been accused of ""internally enforcing the caste hierarchy"". Detailing the nature of harassment, Reuters revealed the victim ""reported Iyer to human resources in November 2016 for outing him as a dalit to colleagues. Iyer allegedly retaliated, but Cisco determined caste discrimination was not illegal and issues continued through 2018, the lawsuit states. Cisco reassigned and isolated the employee, rejected a raise and opportunities that would have led to one and denied two promotions"". Robyn Blum, a Cisco spokesperson, declared the company would ""“vigorously defend itself” in the lawsuit and emphasised the company was committed to an inclusive workplace. Reuters explained ""Like other large Silicon Valley employers, Cisco’s workforce includes thousands of Indian immigrants, most of whom were born Brahmins or other high castes."" A civil rights group, Equality Labs, had claimed in 2018 that 67 per cent of dalits in US workplaces felt they were treated unfairly.

6233,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/fair-abd-lovely-complexion-racism-uniliver-6485752/,A fair-skin obsession is a lifelong training in self-loathing and discrimination,"A little girl and her brother go to the market. They sniff purple flowers, post a letter in a red post-box, spy an orange cat peeking out from behind a basket of green bhindi, and watch their mother haggle with a fisherwoman in an ochre sari. These are images from a wordless picture book for children that artist-writer Manjula Padmanabhan made in 1986. What stands out in A Visit to The City Market (NBT) is the rich earth of the children’s skin, and the many shades of dark brown of other people, from coffee to chocolate to chestnut. For Padmanabhan, one of the most genre-bending English writers in India, the book was a milestone. “Those children are dark,” she told me in an interview in 2015. “Till then, I had been using — not pink, but a soft brown colour. And I suddenly thought: Why don’t I use brown? The full undiluted brown. It was very liberating. But I also realised that many people found it ugly.” I came across the book years later, as an adult, long after I had stepped out of a childhood where the word for dark skin in Bengali — for my dark brown skin — was not just shamla, but moyla (dirty). The ads of Fair & Lovely, beaming in the message of “twacha ka nikhar” even in our unfamiliar-with-Hindi homes, therefore, did not need any translation. A fair-skin obsession in a country where the majority of people are brown is a lifelong training in self-loathing and discrimination. It is tangled with broader structures of inequality, from caste to gender and class privilege, securing them in place with its softer, more invisible power. It works insidiously against the vulnerable, by chipping away at their self-worth. For Hindustan Unilever, it has meant cold, hard profit — Fair & Lovely was made for Indian markets in 1975, and is now a Rs 2,000-crore business. In 2020, comes the turnaround, prompted by the introspection in America of ways by which apparently neutral cultural ideals of success and beauty perpetuate systemic bias. “We recognise that the use of the words ‘fair’, ‘white’ and ‘light’ suggest a singular ideal of beauty that we don’t think is right,” the company has said, while announcing its decision to drop “fair” from the brand name, and assuring us — in the face of 45 years of evidence to the contrary — that it is committed to “a global, inclusive portfolio of skin care brands”. This is suspiciously less than a cosmetic change. More than black or brown lives, profit matters, which in an attention economy run by global social media algorithms, needs insincere social messaging to manage. Neither HUL nor other brands that reign over the Rs 4,000-crore whitening cream market has shown a desire to examine their role in the perpetuation of racist, casteist ideas of skin colour. Nor how deviously they have twisted ideas of women’s empowerment to sell unsubstantiated claims of melanin-suppressing “miracles”. In Fighting Poverty Together (2011), the writer Aneel Karnani, a professor of strategy at University of Michigan, cites HUL research that claimed “90 per cent of Indian women want to use whiteners, because it is aspirational, like losing weight. A fair skin is, like education, regarded as a social and economic step up.” In recent years, Fair & Lovely ads have showed women turning into successful teachers, cricket commentators or a lawyer fighting for “women’s rights” by lightening their skin. In one advertisement, a young working professional proves her worth to her father, who wishes he had a son, by transforming herself into a fair woman. HUL and other brands are not the only ones guilty of colourist bias — from cinema to news television and advertising, there has been little challenge to the upper-caste, North Indian ideal of beauty and desirability. But, given the generations of dark women and men who have been made to feel unworthy because of the colour of their skin, it is not a burden they can shrug off. Exploitative ideas of skin colour do not define you forever. I remember flipping through Padmanabhan’s book, as I read it to my daughter, lingering over a little brown girl dressed in a bright yellow — a colour I was ashamed to wear as a child — and her statuesque mother, a darker shade of brown, also in a yellow sari, and feeling a warm glow of affection: This is us. Not fair, but how lovely.

6274,https://www.forbes.com/sites/drnancydoyle/2020/07/04/is-mandatory-mask-wearing-discrimination-at-work-disability-accommodations-in-the-time-of-covid/,Is Mandatory Mask Wearing Discrimination At Work? Disability Accommodations In The Time Of Covid,"Smiling colleagues wearing facial medical masks greeting each other by bumping elbows gesture at ... [+] workplace keeping social distance, preventing spreading covid19 virus. The debate surrounding when and where to enforce mask wearing is gaining momentum, with much of the debate being dominated either by those that believe it is essential to public safety, and those that see it as a civil liberties issue, with government or business doing the enforcing. In all of this one voice is being drowned out that very much needs to be heard; that of the disabled community. As with vaccines, there is a small percentage of the population that simply cannot wear a mask. They do not have the luxury of debating the pros and cons. Since they have no choice, surely it is even more important for the rest of society to do their part and bring down the overall rate of transmission? The idea that such people should just stay home is reminiscent of the ableism that we encountered at the start of this pandemic when the phrase “it only kills the weak and the elderly” was ubiquitous. What about those that need to work, or have other responsibilities outside the home? Realistically how long can we expect some people to stay home while everyone else is meeting up again? This cannot be the only solution and to suggest so is therefore discriminatory. So let’s look at the other options and how business leaders can be role models of a pragmatic, measured approach in our organizations. The first step in inclusion is often education. I have been asked multiple times recently to explain why certain people cannot wear a mask, and this lack of understanding leads to people feeling that exemptions are actually unfair, with the attitude of “well if they don’t have to why should !?” Allow me to explain; People with sensory processing disorder (this applies to varying degrees across most neurominorities, but tends to be acute in autism) may find the physical sensation of wearing a mask to be totally unbearable and attempts to tolerate this pain and discomfort could lead to public meltdowns and panic attacks. People who are claustrophobic or who have experienced trauma related to having their face covered are also at risk of panic attacks and emotional overwhelm. Finally, those with breathing difficulties may be triggered by a mouth and nose covering. There may be others that I have not included in this list, so be willing to listen and trust people if they tell you that mask wearing is not physically possible for them. These are genuine physical responses that are not within the persons control, it is simply not equivalent to finding masks a bit uncomfortable or impractical. Making adjustments to allow for a small number of non-mask wearers is actually surprisingly simple. My first suggestion would be to accommodate home working wherever possible, but that isn’t the only approach we should consider. Discuss with your team member if they can change their working hours to reduce their contact with others. Even a shift of a few hours earlier or later will help reduce contact and may also allow for them to travel outside of peak times. If an employee is non-mask wearing, they could also commit to monitoring their contacts and making sure they quarantine if they have been exposed. We could make sure they are not in closed spaces with colleagues who are vulnerable. We don't have to get into a zero sum game about whose needs are most important, balance and sensible compromise is possible. Also look at ventilation in your work-space and if you can move workstations around to create additional distance. Consider keeping meetings and catch ups remote for the time being, or have outside meetings! My office is based in a countryside location and my colleagues and I frequently take walks instead of sitting around a table. Works well for thinking time and relationship building. Another suggestion that will work for some but not all, is to replace masks with clear visors instead. These are actually more inclusive for Deaf people and those that rely on lip reading. In fact whilst we’re on the topic, I highly recommend the use of masks with a clear panel in the middle for this very reason. One of the larger concerns for people who cannot wear masks is the fear of persecution, or that their exemption will mean that others do not feel obligated, leading to increased risk for all. We need to address the fear of being challenged. Research from Disability Rights UK suggested that 60% of people who cannot wear a mask fear being challenged. Some businesses have addressed this by creating exemption passes. This is an excellent solution for people that feel comfortable with the idea, but not everyone feels safe wearing something that displays their medical or psychological history. We must make allowances for this also and maintain confidentiality. Regrettably, there is no perfect solution to this particular scenario other than to trust people with hidden conditions to do the right thing and educate those that would object. I think there's an opportunity here to show commitment to inclusive, thoughtful leadership. The more we can increase public awareness of the importance of mask wearing while also increasing knowledge about the validity of exemptions the closer we will get to striking the right balance. *** additional note*** I've been advised that you can acquire soft, bamboo fibre eco masks which are less painful for those with sensory processing disorder.

6290,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/24/business/facing-backlash-workers-over-alleged-discrimination-tatte-founder-stepping-down-ceo/,"Facing backlash from workers over alleged discrimination, Tatte founder stepping down as CEO - The Boston Globe","Since launching Tatte Bakery out of her kitchen in 2007, founder Tzurit Or has built a chain of 14 local storefronts with an aesthetic that makes Instagrammers swoon: black-and-white floor tiles with cheeky inspirational quotes, woven Parisian bistro chairs, piles of flaky pastries, and shakshuka skillets studded with silky poached eggs. But the social unrest in the wake of protests over George Floyd’s death has revealed simmering frustrations among the cafe chain’s workforce that have disrupted its otherwise placid facade. Over the past several weeks, current, former, and furloughed Tatte staff have begun speaking out against Or’s leadership, saying she created a culture at the cafes that has enabled “discriminatory hiring practices and maltreatment of Black and Brown employees in entry-level positions,” according to an open letter published by the group last week. Advertisement On Friday, Or confirmed publicly what she said has been in the works for some time: She will be stepping down from her role as CEO of the company that employees over 700 people. The news comes as complaints have emerged about the management of the cafes, including allegations that Or or her managers have made discriminatory comments about the race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or physical attributes of staffers, and that Or made hiring and promotion decisions based in part on how well workers fit in with the “Tatte aesthetic.” The group of former workers and their industry allies, which is now organized under the name Employees for Change, has launched a petition pushing for more diversity among the company’s executive team and has raised funds in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. On July 17 they issued an open letter, which has garnered over 200 signatures, urging Or to step down from her leadership role and raise wages for staff; they have planned a protest outside the Brookline storefront on Sunday. Advertisement Or — who sat down with the Globe for a video interview, in addition to submitting written responses to questions — said she was completely unaware of any concerns about discrimination among her staff until the petition began circulating. She denied having made racist or discriminatory statements, and said that in the past few weeks she has taken steps to address staff concerns, working closely with her investors, led by Ron Shaich, the founder and former chief executive of Panera; meeting and exceeding the demands of the petition; hiring diversity consultants and a crisis management team; and launching a formal investigation into three allegations of discrimination. She said she’s also in the midst of establishing a formal HR department and is working to launch an anonymous hot line for workers to report discrimination. “My personal goal is to make sure that our policies, processes, and training programs all match my hope for what Tatte is and can become — an organization that respects all people,” Or said. But she also acknowledged that management mistakes have been made. The decision to step down from her role as CEO, she said, predated the petition, and new leadership will be announced soon. Her plan is to remain on as an adviser, executing her vision for its pastries, branding, and storefronts. But day-to-day management of Tatte will no longer be under her purview. The reckoning has been “devastating” to her personally, she said. Advertisement “I took it really hard because I felt that all I did is give up on my personal life and everything I’ve ever had to make Tatte into a home that people feel good in,” she said. “I felt massive responsibility to really do some serious listening and learning, and go back to my team and see how are we addressing this and making that change, because clearly something is not right.” *** The recent trouble started several weeks ago, after Or decided to board up her storefronts as protests around the George Floyd killing surged throughout the city. The decision rankled many people of color on her staff, who felt she was doing more to protect her stores than support the movement. Frustrations mounted when Or posted on Tatte’s Instagram page in support of Black Lives Matter. Many workers expressed skepticism about Or’s outwardly supportive stance and said it didn’t match her own internal corporate practices. Hodan Hashi, who worked on Tatte’s counter staff until February of this year, said that as a Black woman, she didn’t experience racism firsthand on the part of the company but she grew frustrated upon seeing Or post about Black Lives Matter on the company’s social media accounts. “Seeing Tzurit post the black square or anything Black Lives Matter-related without seeing the tangible steps she was taking to make sure these things weren’t happening in her own company annoyed me,” she said. Hashi helped draft a petition asking the company to commit to diversifying its executive team, match the employee donations to organizations supporting Black Lives Matter, and donate excess food and beverages to protesters and others who support the cause. It was envisioned to push Tatte to take a more active role in challenging systemic racism, Hashi said. Advertisement But then several past and current workers began posting their experiences on social media and tagging Tatte in their posts. Or waded into the comments and direct messages to respond to the complaints, but that served only to fuel the fire. She ultimately turned off commenting and tagging on Tatte’s posts after tensions boiled over. It pushed the activists to continue the conversation through their own channels. “The stories were just as shocking to me as they were to everybody else,” Hashi said. “It felt like we had some form of a responsibility to make sure that the voices of the people of the company who experienced this but couldn’t speak out were heard.” In the open letter, the writers said “it is more apparent than ever that the CEO has been using the optics of her successful business to overshadow the injustices of the company against its staff.‘‘ The letter goes on to note that “workers have made numerous complaints about mistreatment and microaggressions under the company’s name and have failed to be recognized by Tzurit herself or the corporate team she manages.‘‘ Elle Marston, a former Tatte employee and organizer for Employees for Change who is a white woman, said she feels it’s important to offer a space for people to share their experiences, and began posting them to the group’s Instagram account. Advertisement The Globe spoke with several of the people who shared their testimonials, some of whom did so anonymously for fear of reprisal. In those experiences, several themes emerged. Employees described a workplace that was driven largely by Or’s vision — and her ego. There were exacting standards — every cashew or pecan had to be placed by hand on a pastry. Several said that video cameras installed in the shops made them feel as though they were under surveillance. “People are afraid of Tzurit,” said Marston, who was hired as a baker at the cafe in 2013, and says she was promised a $14-an-hour salary, which she never received. “There is one view of Tzurit in the media, and there is everyone who is being quieted to not tell the true story.” Michael Geldart, who is white and worked at Tatte from 2013 to 2016, where he held the role of head of bakery operations, said the management of the shops was unprofessional compared with other places he’d worked. “There was nobody to go to to guide you on disciplinary action or clear policies,” he said. “We saw the favoritism. There were employees who would get a huge jump in pay based on if they were in [Or’s] good graces or not.” And he said there were numerous occasions when Or said things about employees that made him cringe: In one instance, he recalled, she asked if a particular worker was Arab or Muslim, and then asked that the person be laid off a few days later. She would become uncomfortable around workers who were transitioning genders, he recalled. In another instance, he said, she grew suspicious knowing that an overnight shift of workers were all Black and wanted to install cameras in the shop. “She said, ‘They’re from the projects, who knows what they’re going to steal,‘” Geldart recalled. Or said she does not recall making such a comment about Arab or Muslim workers, and pointed out that she currently employs people with those backgrounds. She said she’s developed good relationships with several members of her staff who have transitioned genders. And she denies having said anything about her Black staff, or that she wanted to install cameras for any such reason. And she added that her own heritage — Or was born in Israel and lived on a kibbutz for most of her childhood, moving to the US at age 32 — means that she wasn’t brought up with an understanding of the racial dynamics that exist in the US that would result in such stereotyping. “Maybe I shouldn’t say it, but I don’t know enough about the difference between Black people and white people to have those opinions — I didn’t grow up here,” she said. “To me it’s all human beings, you know?” Nick Wilson, who worked as the executive chef at the company from 2015 to 2016 and is biracial, mentioned several conversations with Or in which she cited racial stereotypes that made him feel uncomfortable. He recalled returning from a vacation and Or asking him about whether Black people swim. Or also asked about the lightness of his daughter’s skin, he said. Or said she did not recall either situation that Wilson described. Wilson said despite his best efforts to promote people of color from within the store’s ranks, Or always seemed more willing to hire workers from outside the company. “It was always, let’s hire someone else, and it was usually somebody white,” he said. He said his own concerns about losing his job led him to not do more to react to her comments, something that he now regrets. “Shame on us for not necessarily speaking up,” he said. “But when you’re caught in that situation, are you going to believe the random line cook or Tzurit, who’s busy opening new shops and getting write-ups in Oprah magazine?” Several former workers say that they appreciate all that they were able to take away from their time at Tatte — an appreciation for attention to detail and working with such high-quality products. And many also mentioned that Or would take actions that were remarkably kind — Geldart said she bought his family six months of diapers after his daughter was born — but felt those acts of kindness were held out in exchange for expectations of loyalty or long hours. Or’s executive team and investors have come out against the group’s claims, and say that many of the instances now being shared are from years ago, by employees whose own personal history with Or may be influencing their statements. “As a black person I have received nothing but support from Tatte in the trajectory of my career development at the company,” Jason Arias, a current general manager at the Summer Street store, wrote in a letter of support for Or. “Tzurit loves Tatte and the environment she creates for her staff and customers,” he continued. “Conflating workplace difficulties or grievances with the BLM movement is not only irresponsible but dangerous. Racism has never been part of my experience at Tatte, nor is it something that I have witnessed among staff.” And Shaich, who is a friend and adviser to Or as well as an investor, said he has been working closely with her to identify and investigate instances of discrimination among employees. He said three instances of discrimination have been investigated by the law firm Foley Hoag, and two have been substantiated. He said the law firm also investigated the claim that Or made statements about installing security cameras for her all-Black baking crew, but no witnesses came forward and the bakery does not have any cameras installed. “Any allegation of racism ... we will not accept that, period, end of sentence,” he said. “This company today is bigger than one person, and we are very focused on building formal process and a real organization. There are adults in the room and the board is taking an active role to ensure we’re living up to our values. We want to make sure we’re not living in a world of unsubstantiated allegations that are happening on social media. “It’s clearly time for a new CEO experienced in management to help us with the process of growing and running Tatte as we become a larger company,” Or said. “I want to be able to go back in and be proud of this journey,” she said. “I look back and I’m extremely proud and I know that any mistakes that I made, those mistakes never had any bad intent. I was always the one trying to bring people together.” Janelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @janellenanos.

6337,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/08/14/doj-accuses-yale-of-discrimination-against-asians-and-whites/,DOJ Accuses Yale of Discrimination Against Asians and Whites,"The DOJ accused Yale University on Thursday of discriminating against Asian and White applicants in its admissions process. In 2019, Harvard University went to trial over allegations that it had discriminated against Asian applicants in its admissions process, ultimately prevailing against charges of discrimination. According to a report by the New York Times, Yale University is currently facing an investigation by the Justice Department over practices that the government alleges are discriminatory against Asian-Americans and White Americans. In a letter sent to Yale, assistant attorney general Eric S. Dreiband claimed that Yale data suggests that Asian and White applicants have a significantly lower chance of admissions than their equally-qualified minority peers. “For example, the likelihood of admission for Asian American and White applicants who have similar academic credentials is significantly lower than for African American and Hispanic applicants to Yale College,” the letter reads. “For the great majority of applicants, Asian American and White applicants have only one-tenth to one-fourth of the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials.” Dreiband went on to argue that this week that the type of discrimination that occurs in Yale’s admissions process causes social division. “There is no such thing as a nice form of race discrimination,” Dreiband wrote. “Unlawfully dividing Americans into racial and ethnic blocs fosters stereotypes, bitterness and division.” Yale University President Peter Salovey claims that the Justice Department’s claims are without merit. Salovey took it a step further by stating that Yale is committed to diversity. “The department’s allegation is baseless,” said Peter Salovey, Yale’s president. “At this unique moment in our history, when so much attention properly is being paid to issues of race, Yale will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.” Breitbart News reported extensively in 2019 on a lawsuit filed against Harvard University that claimed that the university deployed discriminatory practices in its admissions office. Although a judge ruled that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian-American applicants, the case has already been appealed to a higher court.

6372,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/31/vatican-should-speak-up-chinas-repression-hong-kong-beyond/,Jimmy Lai arrest: The Vatican should speak up on China’s repression in Hong Kong and beyond,"George Weigel is a distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, where he holds the William E. Simon chair in Catholic studies, and the author of “The Next Pope: The Office of Peter and a Church in Mission.” As the democratic world scrambles to devise adequate countermeasures to China’s increasing repression in Hong Kong and beyond, there is one currently disengaged actor that could play a productive role: the Vatican. In the past, under Pope John Paul II, the Holy See was uncompromising in defense of fundamental human rights. That approach is needed now — but would require an overdue recalibration of the Holy See’s recent policy toward China. In recent times, Vatican diplomacy in China has begun from the premise that a smoother relationship on ecclesiastical issues will clear the path to what a generation of Vatican diplomats have sought: full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic. These diplomats imagine this will give the Vatican a place at the table where the great issues of world affairs are sorted out. The eagerness with which this putative grail has been pursued baffles many. The failed Vatican Ostpolitik in Central and Eastern Europe during the 1960s and 1970s succeeded only in disabling and demoralizing local Catholic communities, while the Vatican itself was deeply penetrated by communist intelligence services. Yet that same accommodating approach is playing out today. Two years ago, the Vatican and China signed a protocol aimed at resolving the long-agitated question of how Catholic bishops are appointed in China and recognized as such by the Chinese state. While the text of that agreement remains secret, it was widely assumed to give a prominent role in nominating bishops to the Chinese government. Shortly after the deal was made, a Party congress transferred responsibility for religious affairs in China from the state to the Chinese Communist Party. It now seems as if the CCP nominates a candidate for a vacant bishopric, which the Vatican can accept or decline. The situation of religious believers in China has not improved in any measurable way in the two years since the protocol was signed, with the Chinese government and Communist Party continually encroaching on religious freedom — and even attempting to use the church for its ends. The Chinese regime’s efforts to “Sinicize” the religious communities it permits to exist have intensified, with Catholic and other churches now compelled to teach the thought of Xi Jinping. Church buildings continue to be stripped of external religious symbols. Catholic schools in Hong Kong have been “advised” to extol the virtues of the new national security law Beijing recently imposed on the city, in violation of its treaty commitments to civil liberties in Hong Kong. Even more gravely, a horrific persecution of more than 1 million Muslim Uighurs is being conducted in Xinjiang, using concentration camps, forced sterilizations and other terrors that reek of Nazi practice. The Vatican, however, is not without its own leverage. In September, the Vatican and China will begin negotiations on a renewal of the agreement. There is little doubt that Beijing wants the agreement to continue, if only to maintain the facade of a measure of religious freedom in China and thereby ease international pressures on the regime. This gives Vatican diplomats an opening to press Beijing. Part of that conversation should focus on dropping the spurious charges against Hong Kong media magnate Jimmy Lai and others who have been caught up in China’s repressive tactics in Hong Kong. The national security law has been used as the pretext to arrest activists including Lai, whose Apple Daily newspaper has been a leader in defending Hong Kong’s liberties. Lai himself has been in the front ranks of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong over the past year and is held in great esteem in the city; his supporters even bid up the value of his company’s stock after Apple Media’s offices were raided by the Hong Kong police, the precise opposite of what usually happens when a state cracks down on a media company. Yet if convicted on the multiple charges he faces, Lai, who will turn 72 in December, could die in a Chinese prison. Lai is a Catholic and a generous supporter of the church, but that is beside the point. He has come to represent freedom of the press, freedom of association, religious freedom and popular participation in government — all of which the Catholic Church supports in its social doctrine and which are being curbed in Hong Kong and across China. Thus, Holy See negotiators should press their Chinese interlocutors on Lai and freedom of the press in Hong Kong, as well as an end to the genocide of the Uighurs, the persecution of Protestant house-church Christians and Falun Gong devotees, and the continuing assault on Tibetan Buddhists. The only power the Vatican has in 21st-century global politics is the moral authority that comes with the forthright defense of human rights for all. Such a defense played an important role in the nonviolent collapse of European communism in 1989. Vatican diplomacy should take a lesson from that in its dealings with China, not least in the case of Lai. Given the lack of hard power options to bring pressure on China to correct its abysmal human rights record, soft power may be the only available tool — and, paradoxically, the most effective one.

6440,https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/coronavirus-disabled-people-face-discrimination-from-covid-traffic-schemes/,Coronavirus: Disabled people face discrimination from COVID traffic schemes,"Disability News Service the country's only news agency specialising in disability issues By John Pring on 6th August 2020Category: Transport Councils and other public bodies across England are failing to consult disabled people before approving “discriminatory” measures designed to aid social distancing and encourage cyclists and pedestrians, say campaigners. They have warned that public bodies are ignoring their duties under the Equality Act, and are making life more difficult for disabled people, including wheelchair-users and those who are partially-sighted. The changes are being introduced across the country under cover of the COVID-19 pandemic, using the crisis as an excuse not to consult with disabled people. Critics say the measures are often rushed, poorly planned and discriminatory. Fazilet Hadi, policy manager for Disability Rights UK, said: “Changes to town and city centres are causing major accessibility challenges to disabled people: tables, chairs and signage on pavements, which need to be navigated around; temporary schemes to widen pavements and create cycle lanes with unclear and unsafe demarcation; and banning of cars from streets, excluding disabled people from shops and other services. “For significant numbers of disabled people, parts of towns and cities have become no-go areas. “It is totally unacceptable that planning authorities are excluding thousands of disabled and older citizens from participating in the life of our community.” Broadcaster, campaigner and access consultant Mik Scarlet, who lives in north London, has highlighted temporary measures introduced by Transport for London near his home in Camden, north London, which have narrowed major roads for cars and lorries, supposedly to increase space for cyclists and pedestrians. But Scarlet pointed to a lack of proper dropped kerbs and the loss of blue badge parking spaces, while he said hailing a taxi has become almost impossible in places, and partially-sighted people have suddenly been faced with entirely new road layouts. He told Disability News Service (DNS): “It’s not just London, it’s everywhere. “The amount of stuff that’s coming now from Manchester, from Newcastle, from York, little towns are doing it. “We want a greener society, all disabled people do, but… for us, the pavements are far more important than cycle lanes. “I think there are going to be a lot of people taking their councils to court.” He said no thought had been put into the measures being taken in Camden and across the country. He said: “We are just not being talked to. I can’t believe how little consultation and basic communication there has been.” Scarlet said he believed that when disabled activists started coming out of shielding and noticed what had happened to access in their local areas they would have “a real shock”. He said: “Eventually we will start coming out en masse and I think that that’s when things will get more vocal.” In York, the short-notice pedestrianisation of several streets in the city centre, and the removal of blue badge parking spaces, led to the new York Disability Rights Forum warning last week (PDF) that the changes could discriminate against disabled people. Among the measures introduced by the council was a free shuttle taxi service that picks up blue badge holders from a carpark and takes them to the city centre. But among the forum’s concerns were the failure to consult with disabled people, and the lack of clarity (PDF) on how the measures would work and how safe they were. The council claims that the drivers “regular disinfect the taxis” during the day, but there has been no clarity on how often this is happening. Helen Jones, a disabled campaigner and blue badge-holder from York, told DNS: “City of York Council have drastically changed blue badge parking in the city centre, forcing disabled people to park outside the city walls and use a shuttle system. “Yet they have provided no information about the shuttle, beyond its existence, and so blue badge holders are unable to make an informed decision about whether they can, or should, use the shuttle. “Further, these significant changes were communicated after they had been made and the leaflet was already out of date when it was received by many blue badge holders. “The language within it was patronising, used the medical model of disability and put the onus on disabled people to understand and shoulder the burden of the changes.” Another disabled driver said the council had not considered the fact that, because of COVID-19, disabled drivers “require their independent access even more to protect themselves from contagion when travelling into York”. Concerns have also been raised about the actions of Lichfield District Council in Staffordshire, again including a lack of consultation. The council has temporarily suspended all blue badge parking bays in Lichfield city centre – and created more parking for blue badge holders instead in a nearby car park – “to allow for better social distancing”. A councillor subsequently told the local news website Lichfield Live: “Disabled shoppers and businesses are paying the price for this. “Indeed, I’ve heard of at least one person who is going to shop in a more disabled-friendly town in future because of this decision.” Comments on the website from local disabled residents appeared to back that up. One said she would not be shopping in Lichfield again. Another said: “Disabled people like myself go to town when we need to. “Can’t walk more than 100 yards so now can’t get to the bank, the pharmacy, the opticians and the market. “Businesses really need all the help and support it can get which a lot of retired and disabled people can give.” In London, the campaigning, user-led organisation Transport for All (TfA) spoke out about the failure to ensure access for disabled people as part of the mayor of London’s major new traffic restrictions around Bishopsgate in central London. TfA said in a statement issued on social media: “We fully support attempts to reduce pollution, promote active travel, and avoid a car-based recovery. “However, far more needs to be done to ensure that disabled people are not negatively impacted by these changes, in an increasingly hostile and difficult transport system.” It added: “Disabled people were not consulted before these changes were designed and implemented, but will once again have to feedback with problems after they arise.” Last month, TfA held its online TravelTalks event, with disabled people from across the UK taking part. It looked at the impact of COVID-19 on the street environment and disabled people’s ability to move around their local areas. In a report based on the event, TfA’s chief executive, Kirsty Hoyle, said disabled people were seeing “huge changes that impact accessibility”, including low traffic zones, relocation of bus stops, makeshift cycle lanes, and more street clutter. She added: “At a time when many disabled people are shielding or otherwise not physically outside and accessing streetspaces, there’s a real fear that disabled voices are not present in decision making.” The event highlighted the lack of consultation with disabled people and the need for clear information about changes to the street environment. The user-led charity for disabled cyclists, Wheels for Wellbeing, also raised concerns last month that disabled people’s need for “safe, accessible walking, wheeling, and cycling space” was “not being put front and centre in post-lockdown plans”, which it said could have “disastrous consequences”. Transport for London (TfL), City of York Council and Lichfield District Council have all defended the measures they have taken during the pandemic. Sam Monck, TfL’s head of investment delivery planning for healthy streets, said: “We’re absolutely determined to make sure that our temporary Streetspace schemes introduced in response to coronavirus are inclusive and benefit everybody in London. “All of our cycle schemes are designed to be accessible to adapted cycles and our schemes also undergo an equality impact assessment to ensure that they are inclusive. “We will continue to work closely with our stakeholders on our Streetspace plans and would urge people to contact us with any feedback on the changes.” A spokesperson for City of York Council said: “These are unprecedented times and we are not able to undertake the level of engagement with residents and groups as we would like. “This has been the case with many of the transport measures that have been introduced. “Our priority has been protecting lives and protecting jobs.” He added: “We have specifically invested over £19,000 [since the start of the pandemic] in helping to ensure disabled residents are still able to access the city centre. “We appreciate, given the need for timely intervention, we have not been able to address these concerns completely and we committed at the time of implementation to continue to work with representatives from all those with access requirements as the crisis continues.” Lichfield council said it had taken advice on its blue badge measures from the accessibility information provider AccessAble, but it is not clear whether that advice was accepted and acted on. Councillor Doug Pullen, leader of Lichfield council, said: “We recently made changes to the allocation of blue badge parking bays within Lichfield city centre to improve social distancing measures for pedestrians. “In so doing, we gave consideration to advice provided by AccessAble, to continue to meet the needs of blue badge holders together with government advice on managing public spaces safely as a result of COVID-19. “We have reserved 42 car parking spaces for blue badge holders across the two nearest car parks, which are both accessible and within the city centre, so are good alternatives. “Many of our blue badge holders understand we need to consider the needs of all our shoppers and visitors, but we know for some it is an extra challenge and we are aware of the comments and feedback received from both blue badge holders and businesses. “We are continuing to monitor pedestrian movements and behaviour. “This will help inform whether we retain or change the arrangements.” Anna Nelson, executive director of AccessAble, said: “AccessAble has recently begun working in partnership with Lichfield District Council to see how accessibility can be improved and promoted across the district. “As part of that work AccessAble was asked to provide guidance on the potential relocation of blue badge parking bays as part of the council’s response to COVID-19. “AccessAble’s advice followed best practice and guidance, as set out in BS 8300, and highlighted the need for bays to be positioned close to key amenities (within 50 metres) and on a route that is both accessible and allows for social distancing. “The report was submitted for consideration as part of a wider discussion around supporting local businesses and implementing government guidelines. “Our understanding is that the parking situation in Lichfield is being kept under review.”  A note from the editor: Please consider making a voluntary financial contribution to support the work of DNS and allow it to continue producing independent, carefully-researched news stories that focus on the lives and rights of disabled people and their user-led organisations.

She felt her Highland Lady Trojan teammates’ sneers, and she and her other Black teammate could tell they weren’t exactly welcome at team-sponsored pasta dinners – if they were included at all. Now 23, and speaking Saturday at the Black Lives Matter Rally at Main Square Park in Highland, she said years later, when she would run into those teammates out somewhere, and they apologized for treating her badly. Stories like Simon’s were the rule, not the exception, during the rally, put on by Simon and four other women, three of whom were white. Highland Police officers circled the park on bikes, and a legal observer in a neon-yellow vest made his rounds on foot. Highland Clerk-Treasurer Michael Griffin offered that long before he got into politics, he toyed with the idea of becoming a pastor. As such, a friend gave him a copy of “A Knock at Midnight,” a collection of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.‘s most well-known sermons, and one in which King talked about measuring people in three dimensions -- their inward, outward and upward appearances – spoke to Griffin as relating directly to Black Lives Matter. With regard to the outward dimension, Griffin said he doesn’t appreciate people who claim they’re “colorblind.” Instead, citing Dr. Seuss’s “One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish,” he said people need to instead embrace and celebrate everyone’s diversities. “I love the colors God paints with. Good job, God, if I may be so bold,” Griffin said. “The Declaration of Independence was written to say, ‘All men are created equal,’ but we’re not equal; some of us breathe great, while others have asthma. But every one of us has equality and dignity. My wife and I teach our daughter manners because every time she does something courteous, she’s saying, ‘I believe you have equal dignity.’ “When we consider the three dimensions, there will be less ‘them and those,’ and more ‘us and we.’” Wilfred Akanbi, a sophomore at Highland High School, illustrated the need for the Black Lives Matter movement with Amy Cooper, the woman who tried to call the police on a Black man who told her to leash her dog in New York’s Central Park. “She states to this Black man, ‘I’m going to tell them there’s an African-American man threatening my life.’ She knew that her saying this could get him in trouble with the police, but since it was recorded, the police knew that he wasn’t a threat,” Akanbi said. “Imagine if there wasn’t a recording: What would have happened to this man’s life? Police brutality is just a part of the much larger problems of racism and inequality.” In Highland, the department hasn’t had a brutality complaint or had to discipline an officer in the last five years, Deputy Police Chief Pat Vassar said in an email Friday. According to a study published in The New York Academy of Medicine in March, police officers kill approximately 1,000 people in the line of duty per year. Using 2014-2015 data from the National Violent Death Reporting System, Black, non-Hispanic people are roughly twice as likely to be victims of “legal intervention homicide,” the study said. Additionally, Blacks are disproportionately unlikely to pose an objective threat of deadly force, nor are they more likely to be involved in suicide-by-cop or mental-health related incidents, instead getting killed during a warrant check or being wanted with a gun, or vehicular assaults on law enforcement, according to the study. Rally organizer Ellie Dust Belli said that despite social media blowing up with naysayers in the days preceding the event, she said she was happy everyone was peaceful and gracious. The former Highland High School teacher got the idea to put something on because she was tired of no one speaking up for the town’s Black population. “I thought that maybe it was something I should do, then,” she said. For Simon and co-organizer Erica Burnett-Montgomery, it took a minute to trust that Belli and the other white co-organizers would let them be a part of the plan instead of telling them what the plan would be. Burnett-Montgomery, who’s lived in Highland for 12 years with her wife, Monica Montgomery, said that while she’s never felt unsafe in town, exactly, her daughter suffered in school from kids who treated her poorly because she’s Black. Simon and Burnett-Montgomery were pleasantly surprised at the inclusivity, however, and have plans for moving forward. “For me, the movement isn’t just about Black people: It’s about all minorities, including the LGBTQ community,” said Burnett-Montgomery, who said she’s planning to host monthly roundtables to keep the conversation going. “We need to learn to listen.” Michelle L.

6491,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gabrielle-union-keke-palmer-hair-discrimination-psa-193847179.html,"Gabrielle Union, Keke Palmer among advocates speaking out against hair discrimination in new PSA"," Gabrielle Union, Keke Palmer, Marsai Martin and Uzo Aduba joined forces for a PSA about hair discrimination. As a part of Glamour’s September issue, the magazine is calling attention to the struggles countless Black women endure when it comes to navigating the world with their natural hair. Working with Crown Coalition, a group of organizations dedicated to ending hair discrimination, Glamour compiled anonymous, first-hand accounts from 13 Black women across the United States who have had to deal with unwanted and offensive comments about their hair. Union, Palmer, Martin and Aduba read these accounts in the PSA. “I’ve been mocked and ridiculed for the frizzy coils that escape my tightly wound bun,” Martin said. “When I first started pageants, I was told by many to never let my hair be natural for competition,” Union said. “HR told me my hair looked more professional pulled back and in a bun than it did out curly,” Palmer added. Martin addressed the bullying and punishment Black school-age children experience because of how they wear their hair and cited an incident where a teacher cut a student’s hair because her beads were making too much noise. The women also quoted declarations made by other Black women about the importance of loving their natural hair. “I started my locs journey out of convenience, now, it’s an outright protest,” Aduba said. “My hair has a greater purpose than myself and I will not put it away to comply with white cultural standards of beauty,” Palmer said. Martin and Aduba both cited Dove’s 2019 C.R.O.W.N. Research Study that showed the scope of the discrimination Black women have faced when it comes to their natural hair. “Black women are 83 percent more likely to report being judged more harshly on their looks than other women at work,” Martin said. “Black women also reported they are one-and-a-half times more likely to be sent home from work simply because of their hair,” Aduba added. The PSA also called on people to support the CROWN Act, which aims to make it illegal for employers and schools to discriminate against anyone because of how they wear their hair. Currently, California, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington are the only states where the act has been passed. Union, who has been an outspoken advocate for natural hair, even sharing her own journey with hair loss after IVF, said all 50 states should have this legislation passed. “This isn’t just a hair issue. Hair discrimination is racial discrimination, period. Together, we can make our schools and workplaces safer and equal for all,” Union said.

Patty Pansing Brooks of Lincoln said a majority of state lawmakers have already signed on to that resolution, which she introduced Monday rather than continuing to push an anti-discrimination bill. When the Supreme Court in June issued its landmark ruling that made such job discrimination illegal in Nebraska and two dozen other states that had not already adopted those worker protections, Pansing Brooks had indicated that she planned to continue to push Legislative Bill 627 to bring Nebraska’s statutes into conformity with established law. But as days in the 2020 session dwindle, she said, she became concerned whether there was time to move the bill. She said it’s still supported by a majority of state lawmakers, but it would need to pass three rounds of debate, and there’s still the potential for opponents to filibuster and keep it from coming to a vote. That’s why the senator chose to introduce Legislative Resolution 466. She said such resolutions can’t be filibustered. And while resolutions don’t have the legal force of law, she said passage would send a needed message. “For people looking at Nebraska and businesses looking to come, I wanted a positive statement affirming we are welcoming, that we want all employees who are competent and qualified, no matter the person they love,” she said. “It’s a positive sign to send to the LGBTQ+ community and the business community.” Business leaders have said Nebraska’s lack of an anti-discrimination law has harmed efforts to retain and attract workers during a nationwide battle for talent. They say the issue is particularly important to attracting millennials, the tech-savvy generation born between 1981 and 1996 that is now the largest generation in the nation’s workforce. Pansing Brooks said 27 of the state’s 49 lawmakers have already signed on to the resolution, and there are other supporters who were absent Monday when she introduced it. Among the co-signers is Sen. Jim Scheer of Norfolk, the speaker of the Legislature, which could help the measure avoid other procedural hurdles. Nebraska has 49 state senators in the Legislature.

Issued on: 05/08/2020 - 21:54Modified: 05/08/2020 - 22:34 Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa promised to “flush out” political opponents on Tuesday, as activist groups said that scores of campaigners and protesters have been arrested in an expansive clampdown over the past week. Analysts say repression is amplifying in Zimbabwe, nearly three years after Mnangagwa helped oust his former mentor Robert Mugabe. In an unexpected speech to the nation on August 4, Mnangagwa declared that his government is facing “many hurdles and attacks” and that “the bad apples who have attempted to divide our people and to weaken our systems will be flushed out”. “We will overcome attempts at destabilisation of our society by a few rogue Zimbabweans acting in league with foreign detractors,” the president continued. The same day, activist group Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights said it was representing at least 20 people arrested since the government thwarted protests planned for the previous Friday – including Fadzayi Mahere, spokesperson for the main opposition party Movement for Democratic Change, and Booker Prize-longlisted novelist Tsitsi Dangarembga, who were accused of inciting public violence. Covid-19 ‘used as a pretext’ Mahere took to Facebook Live to film police wearing helmets and bearing truncheons coming to arrest her at a restaurant on August 3. Dangarembga, who is currently on bail, told Reuters on Tuesday that “it’s like the people of Zimbabwe are in a chokehold”. On Monday, the hashtag #ZimbabweanLivesMatter trended on Twitter across the globe. “Public repression is indeed intensifying, and it is being applied as a first resort,” Stephen Chan, a Zimbabwe expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, told FRANCE 24. Last week Mnangagwa’s government sent soldiers and police to shut down the capital Harare, thereby blocking the protests planned by Jacob Ngarivhume, leader of the small opposition party Transform Zimbabwe – citing Covid-19 as the reason for the lockdown. “The Zimbabwean government has used the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to strengthen its grip on power and curtail the freedom of expression of the opposition and civil society movements,” Virginie Roiron, a Zimbabwe specialist at Sciences Po Strasbourg University, told FRANCE 24. The demonstrations were intended to decry corruption and mismanagement of the country’s imploding economy – as well as marking two years since the disputed election that cemented Mnangagwa’s rule. Ahead of the suppressed protests, Ngarivhume was arrested with inciting violence on July 20, along with Hopewell Chin’ono – a prominent journalist and documentary filmmaker who in June helped uncover the “Covidgate” scandal, in which the health minister was sacked and arrested over alleged corruption in a $60 million deal to procure supplies for the fight against the coronavirus. A further financial scandal was uncovered in early July, when it was revealed that the Zimbabwean public funds were used to buy luxury cars such as Range Rovers for senior civil servants – costing millions of dollars collectively. ‘Meltdown in health services’ Covidgate emerged amid recurrent health workers’ strikes over low pay and a lack of equipment. Public hospitals are in such a poor condition that “unborn children and mothers are dying daily”, the Zimbabwe Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists told Reuters. “In the time of Covid, the steady meltdown in health services has now become not just a bad dream but a nightmare, and stands in stark contrast to the wealth of the oligarchs who, it seems, are prepared to steal even from the embattled health sector,” Chan said. The broader economic outlook is similarly worrying. Inflation is running at 737 percent – the second highest in the world, behind Venezuela – while the UN’s World Food Programme projects that 60 percent of Zimbabweans will suffer from food insecurity by the end of the year. Mnangagwa introduced a reform package with IMF support in May 2019, including a new currency – seeking to turn a new page after economic crises racked Zimbabwe during the last two decades under Mugabe. But in March 2020 – by which point the new Zimbabwean dollar had lost most of its value – the IMF declared that the country was facing an “economic and humanitarian crisis” and that Mnangagwa’s programme was “off-track” because of “missteps” in its implementation. “The worsening repression is linked to the macroeconomic instability the country is going through,” said Marisa Lourenço, a southern Africa analyst at consultancy firm Control Risks. “The government keeps changing its monetary policy, which is not good for the economy, as it doesn’t address the high inflation rate and limited currency reserves” she told FRANCE 24. “There is a shortage of goods going on, in part because of a drought affecting food supply, but also because the currency shortages mean the government doesn’t have the money to buy what it needs,” Lourenço continued. “So you have people who are starving and people whose livelihoods are now under further threat because of economic stoppages under Covid-19. Meanwhile the government is unable to stimulate the economy – it’s getting no funding support and limited private sector investment because it now has such a poor relationship with the international community.” ‘A lot of fear’ Some of those foreign observers proclaimed their optimism when Mnangagwa allies in the military ended Mugabe’s 37-year rule and installed him as boss in the November 2017 coup – such as Britain’s then international development secretary Rory Stewart, who rapidly flew to Harare, expressing “real hope that Zimbabwe can be set on a different, more democratic and more prosperous path”. This was despite Mnangagwa’s longstanding reputation as Mugabe’s ruthless enforcer. “People chose not to recognise a coup for what it was, even though military coups like that have always been about preserving the status quo; they are not about reform,” Miles Tendi, an associate professor of African politics at Oxford University, told FRANCE 24. “Now we see a very restricted political space for the opposition, and a lot of fear,” he continued. “Zimbabweans are strong enough to overthrow this government,” added Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy and international development at Birmingham University, speaking to FRANCE 24. “But making sure that everyone understands this, and getting them to mobilise at the same time, is extremely hard in the face of a brutal government that is showing no respect for the rule of law,” he concluded.

6735,https://californiaglobe.com/fr/voting-no-on-prop-16-means-no-discrimination-or-affirmative-action/,Voting 'NO' on Prop 16 Means No Discrimination or Affirmative Action - California Globe,"Rally at State Capitol: ‘Don’t Legalize Discrimination’ protesters and speakers say By Katy Grimes, August 10, 2020 12:29 pm “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” That is the opening statement of President Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, November 19, 1863. “We are a nation conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” Ward Connerly told a group of “No on Prop. 16” advocates at the State Capitol Sunday. The California Civil Rights Initiative, known as Proposition 209, protects us from discrimination. Prop. 209, passed by voters 55% to 45% in 1996, said that the state cannot discriminate against or grant preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, and public contracting. Proposition 16, on the November ballot, would repeal Prop. 209 and divide Californians by making discrimination legal in California, Connerly says. Education scholar Lance Izumi, with the Pacific Research Institute, worked with Ward Connerly in 1996 for passage of Prop. 209, and spoke at Sunday’s rally. “Back in 1996, I worked with Ward and others to explain the racially discriminatory practices that had been occurring in California for years, and then explaining the principles underlying Prop. 209,” Izumi said. Izumi offered three important points: “It is important to point out that Prop. 209 is based on the exact language of the 1964 U.S. Civil Right Act,” Izumi explained. This is the bulk of his speech: Proposition 209 says, “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” This similarity to the U.S. Civil Rights Act is extremely important because of the moral case made by President John F. Kennedy and others for passage of this law. In his landmark message on the need for the Civil Rights Act, President Kennedy said: “We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. . . . The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.” Further, he said that all Americans “have a right to expect that the law will be fair, [and] that the Constitution will be color blind.” The United States Congress passed the U.S. Civil Rights Act in response to the moral case laid out by President Kennedy. Similarly, the people of California passed Proposition 209 by a near-landslide majority because of the moral case laid out by Ward Connerly and others, which was based on actual discrimination experienced by Californians, especially Asian Americans, due to government-sponsored racial preference programs. For example, prior to the University of California eliminating race preferences in its admissions process in 1995, there was widespread racial discrimination in admissions throughout the UC system. My institute, the Pacific Research Institute did a study and found that prior to the UC’s elimination of race preferences, Japanese Americans were 13 times LESS likely to be accepted to UC Davis medical school than members of groups benefiting from race preferences. Korean Americans were 14 times LESS likely to be accepted than those who benefited from race preferences. My good friend, the late State Assemblyman Nao Takasugi, who for many years was the only Asian American in the Legislature, testified to the UC Regents: “Let us be clear, what we are discussing today with UC’s special preferential admissions policy is nothing more or nothing less than state-mandated discrimination based on race, the same discrimination that locked me and my family away in the prison of injustice in [the Japanese-American internment camp at] Gila River, Arizona.” Proposition 209 has guaranteed that the injustice that Assemblyman Takasugi pointed out would never happen again in California. Finally, let me say that the effort to repeal Prop. 209 totally fails to recognize that the true culprit for the difficulties of underrepresented minorities gaining entrance into the University of California system lies not with Prop. 209’s anti-discrimination language, but with the failure of the California’s public K-12 system to adequately prepare these students for higher education. The UC Academic Senate has found that for underrepresented minorities, the most significant factor preventing UC eligibility was not Prop. 209, but the “failure to complete all required A-G [college preparatory] courses with a C or better.” Even UC President Janet Napolitano herself admits that, quote, “the biggest contributor to underrepresentation at UC is that students do not fulfill A-G subject requirements for admissions,” unquote. So, if legislators, policymakers, and educators truly want to improve the chances for success for underrepresented minority children, then they should avoid divisive identity politics and get to the hard work of offering better education alternatives for all children in California. Let me end by again quoting President Kennedy’s message on the U.S. Civil Rights Act. The president said that America was “founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.” Repealing Proposition 209 would therefore threaten the equal rights of all people in California. And that would be wrong. A few weeks ago, the people in this building failed to listen to you. But let me tell you, they are going to hear all of you in November!” President Lincoln ended his address: “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion – that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”  Katy, outstanding article! Thank you for reminding us all about the true intent of Proposition 209. I hope the concept stands the test of time as stated through out our history. Vote No on Prop16. Liberty and equality for all. Racial discrimination against any race is immoral and wrong. Justifying such action on the grounds of increasing diversity does not erase the immoral premise. Asian cultures highly value education and the sacrifices family and students make are significant. To punish a group for their effort and performance is a crime. If quotas or affirmative action are reinstated, then do it across the board for all activities, including sports and arts. If the student body is designed to reflect the at large population, then do the same for athletic teams, orchestras, dance groups, drama groups. We must also erase any gender discrimination, so all student bodies would be coeducations with 50% male 50% female as well as basketball teams, football teams, orchestras, swim teams. drama groups, etc. Fair is fair for every group and school. There is plenty of racial discrimination in California but it is against white and asian students. Students with Hispanic names were chosen even though their parents came from Spain generations ago. One that I know of is blond and blue eyed and did not have a great grade record but was taken ahead at Davis before others with better qualifications solely because of her Hispanic surname. The U of Ca. system announced that 70% of the incoming class was Hispanic. We are shutting out some of our most promising student for racial justice. This is racial injustice! This is discrimination in its worst form against students of middle income families who are hard working citizens paying taxes and supporting the educational system. You are 100% correct on this. It’s a breath of fresh air what you have said here. It does not help when so much written about affirmative action and the proposition’s analysis is not clearly stating what it’s truly about. It tries to shield what it will really do and that is to actually openly practice discrimination against American citizens who actually deserve the university spot or employment because of their merit and achievement. They are literally attempting to IMPLEMENT race based discrimination, which was outlawed by the will of the people by Prop 209. That’s where we’ve come now. Proposition 16 is not about Affirmative Action. It is an attempt to scrap provision of California Constitution that guarantees equal rights regardless of race, gender and so on. If you are racist – vote YES for Prop 16. Boris Axelrod Applied Materials Member of Technical Staff Your email address will not be published.

6736,https://www.pgurus.com/ca-vs-cisco-discrimination-lawsuit-a-crude-attempt-at-casting-performance-appraisal-as-a-discrimination-issue/,CA vs Cisco discrimination lawsuit – A crude attempt at casting performance appraisal as a discrimination issue? - PGurus,"Is the case of an individual being taken out of context by the DFEH lawsuit against Cisco to paint Hinduism as being discriminatory? I have had a chance to peruse the 22-page lawsuit being brought by the California Department. of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against Cisco Systems. The first paragraph itself had so many anomalies that I figured it would be instructive to capture the correct depiction of India’s history and its thousands-of-years-old Varna system. In ancient India two great Rishis, Rishi Bhrigu and Rishi Bhardwaj met to discuss how to form a stable society. Then Rishi Bhrigu said there are four sources of power in a society and we must ensure that nobody has more than one of that. The four sources are knowledge, weapons, wealth, and land. These should not be in one hand, not even two should be in one hand. So those who have knowledge will not have wealth, will not have weapons, and will not have lands. Those who will have weapons will rule the country, but they will not make policy. They need to go to people having the knowledge to seek their permission and advice. Those who are having wealth, their social status will be decided by how much philanthropy they do, not by their wealth. Those who have lands must produce for society. In fact, none of these four categories or “Varna” was based on birth[1]. In fact, Rishi Atreya said that everyone is born a Shudra until he chooses a vocation, which defines one’s varna. There were as many as 126 universities spread through Akhand Bharat (a modern-day region comprising Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Sikkim). Caste or Casta is a Portuguese word used to denote class. The Portuguese arrived in India in 1498, when Vasco Da Gama set foot in modern-day Goa. This word is loosely equated with Jati, a word that is used to denote someone’s specialty (and in some cases his commonality as the context goes; e. g. jati of weavers). The Sanskrit word Vigyani (scientist) over time changed to Gyani (knowledgeable) to Jati in modern times. So where did the word Dalit come from? Read on… Krishna explains the Varna system in Bhagavad Gita As illustrated in Figure 2 (Given below), Krishna tells Arjuna, “The four categories of occupations were created by me according to people’s qualities and activities. Although I am the creator of this system, know me to be the non-doer and eternal[2].” Padma Bhushan awardee Dr. Nagaswamy, in his book Tamil Nadu – The Land of Vedas details from reading copper plate inscriptions during the reign of Rajaraja Chola (985 CE to 1014 CE) as to how the government administration composed of 70% Shudras, 15% Kshatriyas and 14% Brahmanas (Page 401). A detailed survey of the Gurukul system was conducted by British officers of the East India Company around 1822 and are detailed in A Beautiful Tree by Dharampal wherein they find in the region after region the majority of enrolled students were Shudras[3]. When Lord Macaulay introduced the English-based education system, it dealt a death blow to the Gurukul system, which was in vogue. There were as many as 126 universities spread through Akhand Bharat (a modern-day region comprising Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Sikkim). This meant that a sizable number of people lost their means of learning education. Since the majority of the students in these Gurukuls were Shudra-born, they suffered the most under the new British dispensation. The independent Indian government kept its word when India became free in 1947 when reservations were extended to education, jobs, and promotions in the government sector. In 1857, almost all of India rose up to fight against the British in what is known as the First war of independence. The British called it the Sepoy Mutiny. The British were a few thousand in number and were running a country that was already around 250 million in population. They needed to ensure that the country remained divided and fought amongst itself instead of fighting the real oppressor, in this case, the British. Two significant things the British brought in after 1857: The Zamindari system was brought by Lord Cornwallis of the East India Company in 1793 through a Permanent Settlement Act[5]. Introduced first in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Varanasi, it spread to the rest of the areas under British rule after 1857, when the British found unsavory characters and made them Zamindars by snatching the land from farmers, who the British thought supported the First war of independence. In many cases, the village thug thus suddenly became a Zamindar (landowner) and could levy any tax on this area of jurisdiction as long as he paid British the promised amount. In 1871, the British wanted to completely break down the means by which the farmers were selling their produce. Throughout India, there were communities who were distribution specialists and could manage to fetch the farmer the best price for his produce. To do this, they earmarked several such communities and made them as outcastes, with draconian laws that required them to have “special permits” even to leave their village. The British stamped them as ‘hereditary criminals’ and thereby made them the “untouchables”. The word Dalit was first used in the 1930s by a reformer Jyotirao Phule to refer to depressed classes, such as the ones above. Dr. Ambedkar then used it frequently in his writings. The 1932 Gandhi-Ambedkar pact was signed in which it was agreed that there would be reservations set aside for depressed classes. And the independent Indian government kept its word when India became free in 1947 when reservations were extended to education, jobs, and promotions in the government sector. The DFEH has made several errors in Paragraph 1. One wonders if the due application of mind and diligence was done before drafting this petition. The petition also is mixing up skin color (a result of pigmentation change based on how long one spends under the sun) to state that the darkest are Dalits. There are about 534 shades of skin color in the Indian sub-continent and anyone whose livelihood depends upon spending a sizeable amount of time in the sun will have a darker complexion. The DFEH is confusing what appears to be a disgruntled employee not happy with his performance evaluation with that of discrimination leading to a filing of this lawsuit. An individual instance of a possible case of mistreatment or bias should not be projected at the entire Hindu religion and the Indian American diaspora. A number of factual errors and sweeping statements made in DEFH’s petition demand scrutiny of what went into framing it.

In all probability the guy has left his religion. Anyone remember the case of an Osmania University student belonging to Vaddera caste (Gajapathi Kings) claiming to be a Dalit, who committed suicide and blamed his ‘Dalit Caste’ for his misfortunes? Also his mom had already left the religion. This case is under the perview of American contitution. Particular company mentioned here was bit laid back along with Motorlo and gave away the pole position to Huawei. It was around 2003, these companies settled legal disputes with Huawei for a token amount without foreseeing trillions of dollor losses in the coming decades. I would say the current cold war is due to the inefficiences of these companies and its executives. No class here.

6763,https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2020/08/19/governor-attorney-general-and-legislators-to-reveal-hate-crime-proposal-this-morning-good-but-dont-overlook-the-broader-legal-discrimination-that-remains,"Governor, attorney general and legislators reveal hate crime proposal. Good and it won't be easy. But don't overlook the broader legal discrimination that remains","Arkansas is one of only three states (along with South Carolina and Wyoming) without a hate crimes law and state officials announced this morning a draft of a proposal to change that in the next legislative session. Governor Hutchinson, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and a bipartisan (but heavily Democratic) group of legislators took part. Sen. Jim Hendren and Rep. Nicole Clowney joined forces several months ago to work on the law and it has support from the Black Caucus, among others. It’s been a labor, too, of Sen. Joyce Elliott since she joined the legislature 20 years ago. The proposal unveiled today DOES include sexual orientation and gender in the protected categories along with race and religion. There is no protection for crimes committed in the name of religion. I note this because In Arkansas, we have a history. A 2017 bill that passed the Senate failed in the House because of opposition from so-called Christians to extending added protection to LGBTQ people. Arkansas law of the Hutchinson administrtion era permits religion to be used as a pretext for discrimination in employment, housing and business services on account of sexual orientation. The state also passed a law to prohibit local civil rights protection for LGBTQ people. Rutledge has participated in lawsuits defending the ability of businesses to discriminate against gay people. The new legislation would enhance penalties for crimes that included hate as a motive. It’s welcome, but a small step against the broader institutionalized discrimination that has been supported by a few of the people participating in today’s news conference. Another sticking point might emerge: Fringe religionist legislators, who don’t like protection for LGBTQ people, have talked about attempting to put police officers in the list of crimes for which enhancements are possible for hate. Crimes against police and first responders already have enhancement provisions under Arkansas law. No police category is included in the legislation unveiled today. Hendren said he expected there’d be back and forth as the legislation progressed This was the meat of the original proposal: It would enhance penalties for existing offenses, by no more than 20 percent, only after law enforcement authorities proved that the perpetrator chose the victim because of the victim’s race, national origin, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. One concern in the final bill is a section that says: If multiple motives for selecting a victim are present, the state may only seek a sentence enhancement under this section if a victim attribute listed in subdivision (b)(1) orf this section was a substantial factor in the commission of the offense. Major businesses have played a role in pushing for such laws around the country. IBM, for example, will take credit for encouraging the law being introduced today. It says the absence of a hate crime law risks setting back the state in education and commerce. The governor was flanked by posters bearing logos of businesses that support the legislation. And one of his chief allies and beneficiaries of his policies, the state’s major business lobbyist, Randy Zook of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce, also spoke for the bill.  Hutchinson said at the news conference he anticipated a “vigorous legislative discussion.” That means the usual suspects will again push their animus against gay people in the name of their brand of religion. Among the legislators present today was one Republican on the House side, Rep. Jeff Wardlaw. Sen. Jim Hendren, the governor’s nephew, is a Republican as well. Democrats Rep. Fred Love and Sen. Joyce Elliott spoke at the event. Another Republican from the Senate, Dave Wallace attended the event. Republican Reps. Joe Jett and Dan Douglas (who leaves office before the next session) also are sponsors. “Why do we have to struggle to do the right thing for our state?” Elliott asked. But she said it likely would be a struggle. She noted the legislation was introduced first in 2001 and she couldn’t get the bill out of House Judiciary after Senate passage. She said clergy turned out to oppose the bill, particularly the part covering sexual orientation. She refused to take sexual orientation out. “I’m proud I refused because here we are 20 years later and I have faith we’re going to do this.” Nicole Clowney said the legislation was needed to demonstrate all are safe and treated equally in Arkansas. She mentioned the recent killing in Little Rock of a 17-year-old transgender woman. Rep. Tippi McCollough (D-Little Rock) said she was a member of a group, LGBT, to be protected by the bill. She, too, cited violence against minority groups. “It’s not OK to prey on the disadvantaged or unempowered.” Jeff Wardlaw said Arkansas “should not be last” in adopting such legislation. Randy Zook said the bill made “good business sense.” Attorney General Rutledge focused on the racial element of hate crime, beginning with the mass shooting in a Charleston, S.C. church, and including the death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of police and of a white child killed by a black neighbor. “We will not tolerate hate in the natural state,” she said. Legal discrimination is, I guess, not hate. Mark DeYmaz of the Mosaic Church closed with a reference to a statement by 70 pastors supporting the legislation. Here’s Hendren’s news release on the legislation. He notes that it includes a section to make it a class C felony to falsely accuse someone of a hate crime. His summary: It would enhance penalties for existing offenses, by no more than 20 percent, only after law enforcement authorities proved that the perpetrator chose the victim because of the victim’s race, national origin, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.  The bill includes a reporting requirement for law enforcement agencies on hate crimes. Here’s the legislation. UPDATE: Here’s homophobe Jerry Cox, leader of the religious right Family Council, defending hate as expected: Hate crimes legislation punishes people for their thoughts and beliefs. In other states, laws carving out special protections for people based on sexual orientation and gender identify have been used to target Christians who disagree with same-sex marriage. No one should be punished for what they say or believe. Unfortunately, hate crimes laws simply do not work. These laws have not prevented hate crimes in other states, and they won’t prevent hate crimes in Arkansas. We wish there were a way to eliminate hate by passing a law, but it simply isn’t possible. Supporters of hate crimes legislation in Arkansas are actively trying to persuade lawmakers and churches to support this bad proposal. That’s why I hope you will contact your state senator and state representative and the pastor of your church. Ask all of them not to support the governor’s hate crimes proposal.

6764,https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/08/1070802,Defeat COVID-19 and put an end to hate and discrimination: UN chief,"Subscribe Audio Hub In a message published on the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Violence Based on Religious Belief, which falls on 22 August, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a rise in racism since the spread of COVID-19 across the world. Mr. Guterres noted that the pandemic has been accompanied by “a surge in stigma and racist discourse vilifying communities, spreading vile stereotypes and assigning blame.” The UN Chief listed some of the disturbing examples of discrimination against religious minorities, such as attacks on people and religious sites, and hate crimes and atrocity crimes targeting populations because of their religion or belief. In order to counter this discrimination, Mr. Guterres called for more action to address the root causes of intolerance and discrimination by promoting inclusion and respect for diversity, as well as for the perpetrators of crimes of this nature to be held accountable. “The right to freedom of religion or belief is firmly entrenched in international human rights law”, said the Secretary-General, “and is a cornerstone for inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies.” States, he added, have the primary responsibility to protect the right to freedom of religion and belief. Initiatives set up by Mr. Guterres to support them include his Call to Action for Human Rights, a Strategy on Hate Speech and a Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites. The International Day was created by a UN Resolution adopted in May 2019, in response to a rise of intolerance and violence based on religion or belief against individuals, which are often of a criminal nature. Launching his Strategy on Hate Speech in June 2019, Mr. Guterres said that “a groundswell of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, violent misogyny, anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred” are being seen around the world, and noted that, in some places, Christian communities were also being systematically attacked. The Strategy aims to enable the UN to respond to “the impact of hate speech on societies”, Mr. Guterres explained, by bringing individuals and groups together who have opposing views; working with traditional and social media platforms; and developing communications guidance. The killing of two people outside a synagogue in Germany on Wednesday has been characterized by the UN Secretary-General as “another tragic demonstration of antisemitism.” A senior United Nations human rights advisor has condemned the criminal attack that took place at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June, in which 49 people were killed and 53 injured, and expressed grave concern at the outpouring of hatred, homophobia and Islamophobia that followed the incident, which targeted the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6772,https://nayadaur.tv/2020/08/pakistani-women-from-minority-communities-face-disproportionate-discrimination/,Pakistani Women From Minority Communities Face Disproportionate Discrimination,"The decision to mark 11th August as the National Minorities’ Day in Pakistan reflected the state’s will to uphold minority rights. The initiative was taken in 2009 by the then government, supported by a number of political parties and carried forward by the successive governments. However, more than a decade later, one cannot mention any significant achievement with regards to advancement of minority rights in Pakistan. As the government of Pakistan marks National Minorities’ Day today, it must seriously reflect on the current situation of minorities in Pakistan, particularly women and girls from these communities. The Constitution of Pakistan guarantees religious freedom and equality to its citizens under Articles 20 and 25. Moreover, Pakistan is also legally bound under the international human rights law to ensure non-discrimination and equality among its masses, including on the basis of gender and religion or belief. Despite these constitutional safeguards, women and girls belonging to religious minority or belief communities face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, which are often severer than those faced by an average Pakistani woman and girl. Gender-based discrimination against the religious minority women and girls ranges from social exclusion in daily life and different forms of harassment to abduction, rape, forced conversion and marriage. They also fall victim to underage marriage that is prohibited by the law. Religious minorities’ population data of 2017’s national census has not been published yet. Therefore, based on the national census of 1998, Pakistan’s religious demography is assessed as 96.28% Muslims and 3.72% religious minorities, including Christians (1.59 %), Hindus (1.6%) Ahmadis (0.22%), Scheduled cast (0.25%) and others (0.07% (Sikhs, Parsis, Bhais etc.) An estimated population of minority women in Pakistan is around 3 million. Out of this, approximately 90% reside in Sindh and Punjab and 92% belong to Hindu, Christian and Scheduled Cast communities. Majority of these women work in informal and formal labour sectors like agriculture, as sanitation, brick kilns and domestic worker. Around two percent of minority women work as teachers, doctors, nursing, professors or in an office.  In general, gender-based discrimination is prevalent in Pakistan. However, minority women’s case has several angles as they face discrimination being a woman in a patriarchal society, then as a member of religious minority communities. And if they happen to be from the poor section of society, which majority of them are, this adds further into their vulnerabilities. A recent study ‘The index of religious diversity and inclusion in Pakistan’ by the Centre for Law and Justice noted that in public spaces, Hindu scheduled caste women can be easily identified by their attire (ghagra and choora (bangle), sari and bindi. Christian women are also sometimes identified from their attire. This identification sometimes results in their harassment. In another survey conducted by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) – Sindh chapter, several minority women and girls, particularly from Hindu community have reported discrimination at their workplace due to their religious believes. 67% women reported that they have been persuaded by their fellow workers or owners to embrace Islam. 40% of respondents reported that they often have to deal with offensive comments and misbehaviour. Members from the Muslim community often joke about their religious practices and it really hurt them, but they have no choice but to tolerate it. In response to the question of being bullied at their work place 59% replied in affirmative, out of which 91 percent said they were abused verbally while eight percent claimed to have been physically abused. In 2019, Christian Solidarity Worldwide carried out a study ‘Religious Freedom Under Attack’, that noted several cases of forced conversion and marriage accompanied with the crime of abduction and rape of minority women and girls. In 2016, as a progressive move to address the issue of forced conversions in Sindh the Provincial Assembly passed a bill against this practice. However, before the governor could sign it into law, religious organisations threatened to hold countrywide protests. Resultantly, the government withdrew the bill. No such legislation was initiated by any other province or at the federal level. In addition, though the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act sets the legal minimum age of marriage at 18 years, but for the minor girls from religious minority this law is totally disregarded on the pretext of so-called religious conversion. Same is the case in rest of the provinces with legal minimum age of marriage being 16 years for girls. Besides this, absence or outdated personal laws of the religious minority communities is one of the challenges for them, especially for the minority women and girls. In 2016, the Hindu marriage bill was first passed by the Sindh assembly and later by the National Assembly, but no rules of business have been introduced so far. The Christian marriage and divorce amendment bill has been presented several times but it has not been turned into an Act of the Parliament, on the pretext of disagreement among some sections of the said community. But this is no excuse for the government to not fulfill its obligation to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act 2017, passed by the Punjab assembly in 2018 is only applicable in the said province. Such legislation is required by rest of the provincial governments. Moreover, family laws are not in place for the other minority communities that provide for a marriage registration/certificate and other important safeguards and arrangements for fulfillment of human rights. In 2012, ‘Life on the Margins’, a study conceptualised by the author of this article and carried out by the National (Catholic) Commission for Justice and Peace on the situation of minority women noted that a high proportion of the women interviewed (42.5%) stopped short of replying to specific questions on faith-based discrimination, for fear of undesirable consequences if the issue was discussed. Nevertheless, 43% of the respondents said that they or a member of their family had faced religious discrimination. A major portion (40%) of discrimination has been at workplace. The educational institutions come at the second number with 24% and in their own localities the ratio is 18%. Only 14.3% said they never faced such discrimination. The study further noted that hate speech is the most rampant form of discrimination faced by the minority women, with 32% of them saying they had suffered such instances. 27% said they had faced difficult and derogatory questions and 19% said that Muslim majority members had disallowed them from eating with them. An adequate political representation and effective participation of minority women in politics is also a big question. Despite the fact that there have been reserve seats for religious minorities in national and provincial assemblies and the Senate, it is rare that these seats are allocated to women from the minority communities. They face double jeopardy in this regard. The reserved seats for minorities are mostly allocated to the male members of the minority communities, and reserved seats for women are mainly allocated to the women from majority (Muslim) community. This shows that minority women are at disadvantage as compare to the women from majority community and male members of their own communities to be in the assemblies. The same trend has been observed when it comes to the local government. This tendency indicates that the minority women face discrimination from their community as well as from the majority community and the society in general. Currently, out of 10 reserved seats for minorities and 60 reserved seats for women in the National Assembly, only one woman (Mrs. Shunila Ruth) is on reserved seats for minorities. In the Senate, not even a single seat has been allocated to minority women out of the 4 reserved seats for minorities. However, only one seat is allocated to minority woman (Ms. Keshoo Bai) out of 17 Senators on women seats. In Sindh Assembly out of total 9 reserved seats for minorities, not even a single seat is allocated to a minority woman, only one legislator (Mrs. Mangla Sharma) is given a seat out of 28 reserved seats for women. In Punjab Assembly, only one woman (Mrs. Ruffin Julies) is on reserved seat for minorities. Out of total 8 seats, from 66 reserved seats for women none is allocated to minority women. In Khyber Pakhtaunkhwa (KP) Assembly, no seat is allocated for minority women out of 4 reserved seats for religious minorities and 26 reserve seats for women. Same is the case with Balochistan assembly with 3 reserved seats for minorities and 10 for women. None is allocated to minority women representative. This whole provincial and national set up speaks volumes about the double jeopardy faced by minority women vis-à-vis their political rights and effective participation. Thus, in order to bring women from the minority community at par and address multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination against them, the government needs to take a multidimensional approach. Multiple reforms should be introduced at law, policy and administrative levels and special measures with regards to their social, economic, civil and political rights must be undertaken. Without these concrete steps to improve the situation, celebrating Minorities Day every year will not change anything. The writer is a human rights professional, researcher and trainer.

They seem to be just as racist as he is. According to a sickening report, several black cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point claim that they were the victims of racially-charged harassment and were treated like a joke when they attempted to report the incidents to higher-ups at the renowned military academy. A startling 40-page policy proposal, complete with testimonies from the black students, was put together by a group of US Army officers who were all recent graduates and/or student leaders at West Point, to address the failings by the school in “uprooting the racism that saturates its history” and calling on the institution to remove honors for Confederate soldiers. First Lieutenant Simone Askew, the first Black female to become West Point’s First Captain and a Rhodes Scholar, wrote in the letter that she found a note that had been slipped under the door of her room that featured “a picture of me holding a rifle, photoshopped with a monkey’s face.” “Though I was aware of the historical precedence of portraying Black people as monkeys, I wondered if the depiction suggested something deeper about my leadership,” she penned in the letter. “Racing through my mind were all the presentations and conversations that I had given in the past 14 days as First Captain and whether I had made any mistakes.” Adding, “This self-interrogation fueled in me a paralyzing fear.” “I was called a ‘n—-‘ during my freshman year at West Point,” another person wrote. “I was told that I was going to rob someone because I was Black. A student made a noose and put it on his Black roommate’s desk as a joke. I was called ‘white’ because I speak intelligently, which is built on the assumption that white people speak better than Black people. These are just a few of many examples.” Folks, this a prime example if ever there were one of the racism that still exists in every corner and crevice of this country. I don’t give a damn what Donald Trump says. Do you think it's ok Jeff Bezos doesn't pay taxes, takes a trip to space and still asks the US taxpayer for $10B? You can read the full report here.

6893,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/byron-allen-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-204418452.html,Byron Allen & Charter Communications Settle $10B Racial Discrimination Lawsuit – Update," UPDATED, 7:10 PM: Byron Allen’s Entertainment Studios and Charter Communications have agreed to settle Allen’s $10 billion racial-discrimination lawsuit against the telecommunications giant. The parties put out a brief joint statement tonight announcing the deal. “Byron Allen’s Entertainment Studios Networks has resolved and withdrawn the lawsuit against Charter Communications.” Read details of the case below. The settlement is the latest for Allen, who announced a deal last summer to end his $10 billion action against Comcast Communications. More from Deadline Comcast, NBCU Chiefs 'Optimistic' Summer Olympics Will Happen, And Say Advertisers Are Too Charter Reports Slower Customer Growth In Q4, But Results Clear Wall Street Bar April Ryan To Join Byron Allen's TheGrio.TV As White House Correspondent And D.C. Bureau Chief PREVIOUSLY, August 29: Byron Allen and Entertainment Studios announced Friday that its lawsuit against telecommunications giant Charter is set to move forward. Federal District Court Judge George H. Wu has ruled in favor for Allen’s $10 billion lawsuit against Charter Communications for racial discrimination. The latest move comes after Wu initially appealed the decision in 2016 and upheld his ruling in November 2018. In March 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the entertainment boss needed to provide evidence to support his claim of racial discrimination from the communications company. With Judge Wu’s latest ruling, Allen can now proceed to bring legal action against Charter. “Charter once again tried to claim in a court of law that the First Amendment gives them the right to discriminate against Black people. This is a despicable, racist legal position, and I’m highly-confident Charter CEO Tom Rutledge and the Charter Board of Directors will be held fully accountable,” Allen said in a statement. “Charter has now been told by Judge Wu twice, and the Ninth Circuit, that the First Amendment does not give anyone the right to discriminate against 100 million minorities in this country.” In the Hurley case, parade organizers in Boston did not want gay people in their parade, and the parade organizers prevailed by using the First Amendment to discriminate against gay people, and unfortunately, this miscarriage of justice was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1995. Charter sent their high-powered lawyer, Patrick Philbin, who defended Donald Trump in his impeachment hearings, into the courtroom to represent them. Charter and their lawyers should have denounced that horrible Hurley decision, but instead relied on this legal precedent of discrimination against gay people and tried to use this legal precedent in a civil rights case against Black people. This tells us everything we need to know about Charter under CEO Tom Rutledge.” “Charter’s legal defense is the epitome of systemic racism. Charter will continue to lose this case, and I am going to make an example of them for all of America to see, because structural racism will not be tolerated. Systemic racism kills us in the schoolroom, kills us in the boardroom, and kills us in the courtroom, long before it kills us in the streets,” Allen continued. The Entertainment Studios founder and CEO has also brought a similar lawsuit against Comcast, also $10 billion, accusing the media conglomerate of racial bias and alleged violations of the Civil Rights Act. In June, Allen and Comcast reached a settlement which saw the network extend terms for The Weather Channel and 14 television stations.

Click here to request advice. Click here for a list of all Tenants Advice and Advocacy Services in NSW...   This website is produced by the Tenants’ Union of NSW in collaboration with the network of Tenants Advice and Advocacy Services   SYDNEY  REGIONAL  ABORIGINAL  Bronwyn Bate • 17/08/2020 This piece was originally published in the Parity edition 'Tenancy and Tenancy Reform in Troubled Times: Covid-19 and Renting'. Parity is Australia's national homelessness publication. Guest blogger Bronwyn Bate is a PhD Candidate at the Urban Research Program, Western Sydney University In the absence of any legislated right to housing, or rules and guidelines such as waiting lists or criteria determining housing priority (as is the case in public housing), the decision to accept or reject a tenancy application, in the private rental market, is essentially “competitive”. It sits solely in the hands of the landlord, and, in many cases, the real estate agent, who provides expert advice to the landlord (1, 2). This puts some tenants at a disadvantage when trying to rent a home. Despite this, proposals for reform of residential tenancies legislation in Australian states and territories, rarely consider legislation that impacts a tenant’s ability to actually secure a rental property. Emphasis in recent reform processes around key tenancy legislation in the various jurisdictions across Australia has focused on establishing greater rental security for tenants currently living in a rental property, in particular around reforms to remove ‘no grounds’ or ‘no reason’ evictions. These legislative changes are important, but it is also important to consider the ways tenants can be better protected from discrimination during the rental application process. If we want to make private rental more accessible, and as importantly, more secure and sustainable to those experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness we need to also assess the ways some tenants are at a greater risk of being excluded from the private rental sector. While Australian tenancy legislation varies between States and Territories, generally, it is unlawful for real estate agents and landlords to discriminate in the provision of rental housing on the grounds of a tenant’s age, disability, race, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy or responsibilities as a carer (3, 4). If a tenant feels that their application for a tenancy has been declined, or they have been treated less favourably, by a real estate agent and/or landlord based on any of these grounds, they can make a complaint to the relevant agency within their state or territory. Despite tenancy legislation designed to protect tenants from discrimination, a considerable number of tenants still experience discrimination when applying for a rental property. Further to unlawful discrimination, there are also other types of discrimination which are considered lawful. For example, an Australian survey of private renters, commissioned by Choice, National Shelter and the National Association of Tenant Organisations (5) found that 50% of tenants have experienced discrimination in the private rental sector. This includes discrimination on the basis of: pets (23%), receiving government payments (17%), age (14%), being the parent of young children (10%), being a single parent (7%), race (6%), needing to use a bond loan (5%), gender (5%), disability (5%) and sexuality (2%). This suggests first, discrimination in the Australian private rental sector is widespread. Second, there is a need to re-examine what is considered to be unlawful discrimination in the private rental sector. Lawful discrimination, particularly with regards to pet ownership and receipt of government payments, is significant. The Choice et al survey results reflects other research suggesting that securing privately rented accommodation is particularly difficult for pet owners (6) and low-income households (7, 8). The difficulties for low-income households to secure a rental property is expected to worsen as casualisation in the workforce continues to grow (9). Discrimination exists on a spectrum and can be overt or subtle. This makes concepts around unlawful and lawful discrimination during a tenant’s search for a rental property complex. For example, a tenant who doesn’t receive a call back from a real estate agent based on their name being “non-Anglo” is one way that real estate agents discriminate against tenants (10) (11). Another form of discrimination occurs during the application and selection process. During the application process, the real estate agent and/or landlord assesses the risk of any potential applicant, with the aim of choosing the best possible tenant (based on all applicants received). The aim here is not to choose a suitable tenant for the rental property but the “best” tenant. This places some tenants at a disadvantage when applying for a rental property, making them subject to the bias of landlords and real estate agents, particularly in a high demand private rental sector, where real estate agents and landlords have significant choice over prospective tenants (12) (13) (14). A study by Short et. al (15) examined the ways real estate agents assessed the risk of prospective tenants during the application process. The two most important qualities a real estate agent look for are a tenant’s ability to pay the rent on time and their ability and/or willingness to take care of for the rental property. Certain tenant characteristics that signal an inability to pay the rent on time or an inability to care for the rental property are seen as “risky”. Short et. al (16) state that “being on a low income was the principal and overarching factor” which real estate agents considered to be risky. Other factors included: Similarly, through an analysis of articles on leading online Australian real estate sites www.realestate.com.au and www.domain.com.au, my research (17) argues that a tenant’s ability to impress the real estate agent matters. My research identifies six aspects of interactions between the real estate agent and prospective tenant that affect their chances of securing a rental property. Through these interactions, tenants can highlight their desirable characteristics while downplaying their undesirable characteristics. The ability to make a good impression on the agent, however, is largely based on a variety of factors that place some tenants at a disadvantage. For example, factors such as English proficiency and the ability to “dress to impress” are often a reflection of economic and cultural capital. Similarly, the ability to demonstrate responsibility appears significantly harder for people with no previous rental history such as younger people, newly arrived migrants and people who are re-entering the private rental sector. My research highlights how Australian real estate sites present the issue of tenants securing rental housing as an individual problem as opposed to recognising the larger systemic issues of housing shortage in Australia. Lastly, Curry’s (18) research points to the ways rental application forms have the potential to “trigger implicit bias” among landlords and real estate agents and the need for a standardised rental application form that limits the amount of information a landlord and/or real estate agent can legally request from a tenant, reducing the potential for bias during the tenant selection process. However, Short et. al. (19) argue that while some level of “transparency” may be achieved through the rental application form, there are no guidelines around how landlords and/or real estate agents decide from two equally qualified applicants. This is unlike public housing where rules and guidelines such as waiting lists or criteria determining housing priority apply. Discrimination in the Australian private rental sector is a widespread and ongoing problem. While there is Australian tenancy legislation to protect the rights of tenants against discrimination when applying for a rental property, the above research suggests legislation alone is insufficient as a strategy for addressing unlawful discrimination. Further strategies are also required to address other forms of discrimination, which although “lawful”, are not necessarily equitable or ethical and are clearly restricting many renters’ ability to secure a home. There is a need to reassess the application and selection process and the ways this process reinforces disadvantage in the Australian private rental sector. Future policy reforms should include: It appears that the dominant view among policymakers, landlords and real estate agents is that the landlord should be provided with extensive information to be able to choose the “best” applicant for their rental property. However, as renters and advocates have long wondered, how are landlords and real estate agents making decisions when they have two or more equally qualified prospective tenants? Further, when private rental housing is the only option, what happens to those applicants who aren’t the “best”?  1.

7105,https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/disability-discrimination-workplace/,How to Handle Disability Discrimination in the Office,"Plus, how to know when you should involve a lawyer. No matter how old we are or how long we’ve been working, we all have questions when it comes to careers—from how to respond to a rejection letter to learning to say no when a role isn’t a good fit. That’s where Career Counselor comes in. In this weekly series, we connect with experts to answer all of your work-related questions. Because while we don’t all have the luxury of a career coach, we still deserve to grow in our careers. Even though the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law in 1990, disability rights still have a ways to go. Last year only 19.3% of people with a disability were employed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And it doesn't help that nearly 20% (one million) of people with disabilities have lost their jobs since March due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In the ADA, a disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. This can range from being diabetic to requiring a wheelchair to having cystic fibrosis to being in remission from cancer. And although though 61 million Americans currently live with a disability, according to the CDC, disability discrimination in the workplace is still alive and well with more than 24,238 discrimination cases filed in 2019 alone, per the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. There are various ways an employer can discriminate, such as through hiring or terminating employees, preventing promotions or wage increases, lacking accommodations in the office, or even illegally using medical exams. But there are ways to advocate for yourself and others. Below we connected with a few experts to find out how you can handle disability discrimination in the workplace, whether it's affecting you or someone else. “It is important that people with disabilities feel certain within themselves that they, with their skills, will be an asset to the company. Secondly, maintain a healthy perspective when confronting ableism. While it is reasonable to expect a level of downplaying and questioning of your abilities, don't allow those thoughts to seep into your psyche. People with disabilities have to refrain from idolizing people who are able-bodied and allowing the anticipated biases to intimidate them before and during the interview process.” — Dayniah Manderson, Miss Wheelchair NY 1997. Middle school English teaching suing the NY DOA for reasonable accommodations. “If you need an accommodation to perform well at work, then it is really important to let your employer know in confidence right away. Indeed, your employer needs to understand what you need so they can help you so that in turn, you can give them the best job performance possible. This is a win-win for you and the employer as your success leads to theirs and vice versa. ""Also, if you don't tell your company that you need disability accommodation, and then you fail at your job because you don't have the accommodation, the failure is on you. But if you let them know you have a need for an accommodation due to a disability and they don't provide it, it's on them.” — Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, president of RespectAbility ""It is best to read up on ASKJan.org about what kinds of accommodations are 'standard' for the kind of disability issues that you have. Ask yourself, what solutions have worked for you in the past? What will help you do a great job in your role today and tomorrow? Then set up a private conversation with the head of HR. Let them know you have a disability and what disability job accommodation needs you to have as a result. — Mizrahi ""Once you feel confident about your reasonable accommodations request, schedule a meeting with your manager to discuss which accommodations are needed. During the meeting, stay confident and stand up for your rights as a valuable asset to the workplace or you wouldn’t have been hired in the first place. A good manager will always look out for your best interest and your rights, as a person with a disability, are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)."" — Becky Kekula, Little People of America (LPA) employment chair and motivational speaker “They may not understand the need, may have forgotten or gotten busy. Don't assume they are against you. Have another conversation with them about it. Be sure to document the conversation with a follow-up email. Keep records of all these interactions. If for some reason they discriminate against you, then you want a 'paper trail' to show that you notified them that you have asked for accommodation and that it has not been delivered.” — Mizrahi “Follow a chain of command in addressing your issue and try to communicate in writing from the onset, if possible. Be mindful of when supervisors are being dismissive of your concerns and are willing to go over your supervisor's head if he/she doesn't demonstrate competence or sensitivity in handling your issue. Be mindful that you might have to explain the importance of having a particular need met—sometimes able-bodied people just don't know or understand, so do not be overly assertive.” — Manderson “First become familiar with the ADA. Educate yourself on what is and what is not considered a reasonable accommodation request. If your employer has ignored your request for an accommodation, your first step should be to make sure you were clear with what you were requesting. Put your request in writing, addressed to your manager and the human resources department, and specifically mention the ADA.” — Kekula “You should always try to work it out without a lawyer [first], as legal remedies—while they exist—can be expensive and slow. The honest truth is that right now, it is very hard to get a job, so people have every incentive to try to make things work to keep their jobs. But if you are fired due to disability discrimination then it's a good idea to get legal advice, even if you decide not to pursue a lawsuit.” — Mizrahi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7216,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-08/op-ed-trumps-wants-to-make-trans-discrimination-legal-again-dont-let-it,Trump's HUD wants to make transgender discrimination legal,"The need for universal access to safe, stable housing may have never been more urgent. The grave health risks faced by those experiencing homelessness are only made more severe by this pandemic. Los Angeles, which has one of the highest rates of unsheltered homelessness in the country, has seen numerous COVID outbreaks among unhoused communities, and experts predict that Los Angeles may be facing an increase in homelessness of up to 16 percent due to COVID. The most marginalized among us are left particularly vulnerable to both the virus and its lasting economic impact. This is particularly true for transgender Americans, who are disproportionately afflicted by poverty and homelessness even in better years. But instead of strengthening support for the trans community, the Trump administration has taken steps to weaken it. In July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, under the leadership of Secretary Ben Carson, proposed a dangerous new rule that would allow taxpayer-funded emergency shelters to discriminate against transgender people. By permitting shelters to serve people on the basis of “biological sex” without regard for gender identity, this rule would explicitly grant single-gender shelters permission to close their doors to transgender people experiencing homelessness. Mixed-gender shelters would be allowed to force transgender people to access services based on the gender they were assigned at birth instead of their gender identity. This places them at increased risk of gender-based violence and sexual assault. HUD’s stated mission is “to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all,” and to “build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination.” This proposed rule runs directly counter to that mission. Transgender people face devastating rates of homelessness across the United States. Nearly one-third of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey — a major accounting of the experiences of trans Americans — reported being homeless at some point. One in eight said they had been homeless within the previous year. The survey results paint an even more dire picture for Black trans women, a group especially vulnerable to abuse, violence and HIV. More than 50 percent of respondents said they had experienced homelessness at some point in their lives, and nearly one-quarter of them reported being homeless within the previous year. If this rule is adopted, it will endanger trans people. Many of those experiencing homelessness will not seek shelter, fearing discrimination (which nearly 30% of transgender people seeking shelter have experienced) and potential violence (22% of trans people experiencing homelessness report being sexually assaulted by shelter staff or residents). Those who do seek shelter will be more likely to be turned away or harassed for who they are. In the context of COVID-19, this means that trans people experiencing homelessness will be at a heightened risk of falling ill, since shelters are many communities’ best access point to the safe, individual housing options that the CDC stresses must be made available to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. It’s true that, in the time of COVID, shelters might not always be safer than unsheltered living. But individual housing options —such as the hotel rooms offered through California’s Project Roomkey — absolutely are. To ensure equitable access to housing, we need to ensure equitable access to emergency shelters. Enforcing equal access to shelter is the least we can do for transgender people in our communities. They are ordinary people whose lives should never be used as a political wedge issue in cynical campaigns that try to turn neighbors against one another. Rather than thinking of new ways to make trans people’s lives more difficult, the Trump administration should be developing and executing strategies that build on the progress made under the Obama administration, which dramatically reduced homelessness for LGBTQ+ people, veterans and families. The federal government should not target the rights of trans people. Instead, as a society we should be dedicated to helping the trans community, which has historically experienced social and economic harm because of who they are. All too often, American society has failed to provide crucial and necessary support for the estimated 1.4 million transgender Americans — including one in 50 teenagers — who have lived authentically despite great obstacles. That cannot be the case once again. The Housing Saves Lives campaign is working to stop this discriminatory new proposal, which has a comment due date of September 22nd. The HUD must uphold its own Equal Access Rule, in both letter and spirit. Julián Castro was secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 2014 to 2017.

It stands for “creating a respectful and open world for natural hair,"" and it would make discrimination based on hair styles or textures illegal. If you want to receive local news alerts, please download our WPXI News App. You can also follow WPXI on Facebook and Twitter. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Allegheny County) is one of the bill’s sponsors. “To be told that not only is it lesser, but it’s unacceptable, it hurts our psyche, it hurts our conscience and it hurts our development,"" Lee said. “As we see with schools all across our country, young Black boys and girls are being suspended because of the way that they show up because of their hair.” According to the Crown Coalition, Black women are 1.5 times more likely to be sent home from work because of their hair. Lee told Channel 11 this prejudice is especially prevalent in schools as well. In January, a Central Catholic student was told to change his hair or go home. Julian Younger started a petition to lift Central Catholic’s ban on braids and twists. Despite getting tens of thousands of signatures, the policy still stands. Right now, the Crown Act is law in these seven states: California, Colorado, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and Washington. Twin bills are being introduced in both chambers of Pa.'s general assembly. Channel 11 will track their progress and report what happens. TRENDING NOW: Cox Media Group © 2021 Cox Media Group.

7353,https://www.kcur.org/news/2020-09-29/kansas-city-looks-to-ban-discrimination-based-on-hairstyle,Kansas City Looks To Ban Discrimination Based On Hairstyle,"Sandra Thornhill has been thinking about — and suffering for — her hair as long as she can remember. “Since I was a little girl…worried about my hair, getting burned by the hot comb to get it straightened out on a Sunday morning to be presentable,” Thornhill says. As an adult, Thornhill says she would spend hours twisting her hair so that it looked like the perfect Afro. It wasn’t until graduate school that she decided to embrace dreadlocks — a decision she says allows her to be more present at work and in public. Thornhill, who now works for the nonprofit organization Shirley’s Kitchen Cabinet, says she wants her two-year-old son, Jerren, to feel the same freedom. She’s advocating for Kansas City officials to pass an ordinance that would amend the definition of race in the city charter to include “hair texture and protective hairstyles” like dreadlocks, braids or twists. “To raise him in a city that is going to accept him for who he is as a Black male, who will be able to present himself fully without changing his hair, is going to mean a lot,” Thornhill says. The ordinance, also known as the CROWN Act, which stands for Create a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair, was introduced by councilwomen Ryana Parks-Shaw and Melissa Robinson. It will be heard by the city’s Finance, Governance and Public Safety Committee on Wednesday. At a press event Tuesday at Plush Life Beauty Lounge in the midtown area, Parks-Shaw said the idea was embraced by her colleagues on the council. She said even throughout her campaign for city council, she grappled with whether to wear her natural hair straight or curly. “Because I wanted voters to see me for who I am, but I know that that hair does make an impact,” Parks-Shaw says. A study conducted by Dove in 2019 found that Black women are far more likely than non-Black women to be sent home from work because of their hair, and that 80% of Black women said they’ve changed their hair from its natural state to fit in at work. The proposed ordinance would apply to all employers in Kansas City, Missouri. Councilwoman Melissa Robinson said this is a chance for her colleagues on the council to match their rhetoric on discrimination with a policy commitment. “We talk about making an inclusive and a whole community, but oftentimes we don't have the laws and the policies that line up to that inclusivity,” Robinson said. Jennifer Duckworth, owner of Plush Life Beauty Lounge, says she looks forward to the passage of this measure. “Far too many times, I've heard my clients say while sitting in my chair, ‘I'm going in for an interview tomorrow, so I'm getting my hair blown out, smoothed or straightened because I'm afraid that my hair in its natural curly state won't get me the job,’” Duckworth said. California was the first state to pass the CROWN Act, followed by New York and New Jersey. If it passes the full council, Kansas City will become one of the few cities to provide such protection. Similar legislation was introduced last year at the state level by Kansas Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau and Missouri Rep. Barbara Anne Washington but didn’t make it to vote by the legislature in either state. Michelle Watley, founder of Shirley’s Kitchen Cabinet, which is dedicated to advocating for Black women, said the coronavirus pandemic complicated this year’s legislative sessions. “We’re hopeful that we can work with legislators on both sides of the state line to reintroduce both acts in the coming legislative year and hopefully get them passed at the state level,” Watley said. She said the significance of this legislation is only greater in today’s climate, as employers across the country deal with a reckoning on race and inclusivity. “Rules that ban locks, braids, and twists are rooted in racist stereotypes about Black hair being unkempt, unclean, unprofessional and not beautiful,” Watley said. “We want to ensure that Black people have the same opportunities to enjoy academic opportunities and economic opportunities and not being blocked from those opportunities simply because of the natural state of their hair.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7358,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/09/14/elec-s14.html,"Trump, Roger Stone call for violence and repression after Election Day","At a campaign rally and in a television interview, President Donald Trump reiterated his threats of police-military repression during and after the Nov. 3 election to maintain himself in power. He suggested again that he “deserved” a third term, for a total of 12 years in office, although that would violate the US Constitution. His campaign speech Saturday night in Minden, Nevada, a small town outside of Reno, included a litany of insults and threats against his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and a claim that he would defeat Biden in Nevada and nationally on Nov. 3. “And then, after that, we’ll negotiate, right?” Trump said. “Because we’re probably—based on the way we were treated—we’re probably entitled to another four after that.” Trump has repeatedly suggested staying in office beyond the two-term limit set by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. Trump also claimed that he could not be defeated in the Nov. 3 election unless the vote was “rigged.” Opinion polls show him trailing Biden both nationally and in virtually every “battleground” state, including Nevada, although many polls show the race tightening. The same day, Trump gave an interview to the “Justice with Jeanine” program on Fox News, hosted by Jeanine Pirro, in which he openly threatened violence against political opponents. Pirro asked, “Let’s say there are threats, they say that they’re going to threaten riots if they lose on Election Night, assuming we get a winner on Election Night. What are you going to do?” Trump responded, “We’ll put them down very quickly if they do that,” adding, “We have the right to do that, we have the power to do that if we want.” He then cited the Insurrection Act of 1807, which he had threatened to invoke in June against the mass protests against police violence that swept the United States after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Referring to National Guard and other federal troops, he said, “We just send them in and we do it very easy. I mean it’s very easy. I’d rather not do that because there’s no reason for it, but if we had to, we’d do that and put it down within minutes, within minutes.” Later in the same interview, he claimed that demonstrators against police violence were being paid for by rich liberals. This is an argument made in explicitly anti-Semitic terms by the fascistic QAnon group and the ultra-right Breitbart News, who portray liberal billionaire George Soros, a survivor of the Holocaust, as responsible for left-wing political activity in America. Trump also defended the police assassination of Michael Reinoehl, the anti-fascist protester from Portland gunned down Sept. 3 by police belonging to the federally-led Pacific Northwest Violent Offenders Task Force. He emphasized his personal role in ordering the killing of Reinoehl, saying, “Two-and-a-half days went by and I put out when are you going to go get him? The US Marshals went in to get him.” He continued, “The US Marshals killed him and I will tell you something, that’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this. There can’t be guys standing up that want to fight…” Even more wide-ranging threats of violence came from Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political crony and adviser, whom Trump saved from the prospect of prison in July by commuting his sentence for lying to congressional committees and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Stone appeared Sept. 10 on the “Infowars” program hosted by the fascist Alex Jones and said Trump was likely to lose the Nov. 3 election, although he claimed this would be the result of voting being “corrupted” through the use of mail ballots. He then urged Trump to declare martial law, invoke the Insurrection Act, seize ballot boxes in states like Nevada where mail-in voting prevails, and arrest political opponents in both the media and the Democratic Party. According to an account by the watchdog group Media Matters, Stone said that Trump would have “the authority” to arrest Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, former defense secretary James Mattis and “the Clintons.” Stone cited a report in the online publication Daily Beast about planned protests against Trump if he claims falsely to have won the Nov. 3 vote. “If the Daily Beast is involved in provably seditious… acts,” Stone said, their “entire staff can be taken into custody and their office shut down.” He added, “They want to play war, this is war.” These fascistic ravings must be taken seriously. Trump and his political hatchetmen are deeply unpopular, but they have one important advantage. Their nominal opposition in the Democratic Party represents the same class as Trump—Wall Street and the super-rich—and has no intention of conducting a serious struggle against a power grab by the ultra-right. As the Socialist Equality Party warned in a statement published Sept. 9 by the World Socialist Web Site: “The campaign between Trump and Biden is pitting an administration that is making an increasingly open appeal to violence and police state repression against a Democratic Party campaign that, as always, offers no genuine alternative to the drive toward authoritarianism and war.” Trump does not have an electoral strategy, in the sense of seeking to win the support of a majority of those who vote in the Nov. 3 election, or even in states that could deliver him an Electoral College majority. Rather, he seeks to create such an atmosphere of chaos and crisis leading up to the election that he can assert a claim to rule, backed by the police, sections of the military and armed right-wing groups. More broadly, as the Sept. 9 SEP statement says, “Trump is seeking to create conditions, regardless of the outcome on November 3, in which he will emerge as the leader of an extra-constitutional, right-wing movement.” The threat of authoritarian rule in the United States cannot be fought through the Democratic Party and casting a vote for the ticket of Biden and Senator Kamala Harris. On the contrary, the Democrats represent merely an alternative route to the same destination. While Trump seeks police state rule, backed by armed bands of what he now calls “citizens’ militias,” the Democrats seek to subordinate political life to the CIA and the Pentagon, the reactionary instruments of American imperialism. Throughout Trump’s four years in office, the Democrats have sought to divert all popular opposition to Trump into the blind alley of their right-wing anti-Russia campaign. This continues today, with Biden lambasting Trump for not confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin about alleged “bounties” paid by Moscow to the Taliban for killing American soldiers in Afghanistan, for which no evidence has been produced. Biden has followed this up with a declaration that if elected he will not pull US troops out of Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria. Neither capitalist party, Democrats or Republicans, offers any solution to the crisis gripping American society, including the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting economic collapse and the ongoing rampage of police violence that takes a thousand lives a year. The Socialist Equality Party candidates in 2020, Joseph Kishore for president and Norissa Santa Cruz for vice president, offer the only genuine alternative to the twin parties of big business. We urge workers and young people to contact our campaign and join the fight for socialism.

7414,https://www.ammoland.com/2020/09/lawsuit-against-seller-and-gun-maker-demands-intolerance-and-discrimination/,Lawsuit against Seller and Gun Maker Demands Intolerance and Discrimination,"Ammoland Shooting Sports News Home » Gun Rights News U.S.A. – -(Ammoland.com)- “Family members sue Lubbock man and gunmaker a year after deadly mass shooting in Midland-Odessa,” The Dallas Morning News reported Saturday. “The suit says Kentucky-based Anderson Manufacturing ’should have known’ of illegal gun sales.” After being fired from his job, the perpetrator, a “prohibited person” forbidden by law to possess a firearm, went on a killing rampage targeting police and random victims. Left unsaid is how the company “should have known.” Instead, the plaintiffs are insisting that the court ignores the law and that the defendants be held liable for standards that are impossible to meet. First, there is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. According to Congressional Research Service, “The PLCAA generally bars lawsuits in federal or state court against firearm manufacturers, distributors, and dealers when a third party acquires a firearm from that distribution chain and uses it for criminal ends.” It does not protect against “product liability actions stemming from design or manufacture defects,” nor against “actions brought against a manufacturer or seller who knowingly violated a state or federal statute ‘applicable to’ the sale or marketing of a firearm or ammunition.” How Anderson Manufacturing “should have known” that a private party who legally acquired one of their products would then transfer it to the killer is not explained, because it can’t be. It would require psychic powers. The plaintiffs and their lawyer are looking to blame a party with deeper pockets than the dead killer’s “estate,” and they want the court to ignore the separation of powers and usurp authority by legislating from the bench. They’re also trying to end private sales and overturn PLCAA, major gun-grabber goals as per the Democrat Party platform: To build on the success of the lifesaving Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws; repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy. That’s parroted by the Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket. As for those background checks, the real motive isn’t hard to find. It’s actually flat-out admitted in the National Institute of Justice “Summary of Select Firearm Violence Prevention Strategies”: Effectiveness depends on the ability to reduce straw purchasing, requiring gun registration… Then there’s the matter of the killer having previously failed to pass a NICS check. The real question here is how it’s a good idea for someone “legally” deemed too dangerous to be trusted with a gun to be trusted to stalk freely among the rest of us. As for the private seller, due process should apply if anything resembling the Bill of Rights still applies. Instead, per Everything Lubbock, his home has been raided, his firearms have been confiscated, and the feds have asked a judge to “permanently forfeit” them – all without a conviction for a crime. The plaintiffs’ lawyer alleges the seller should have known the killer was ineligible to own a gun because he had “two teardrop tattoos on his face.” First of all, there is no state or federal law prohibiting people with tattoos from owning guns, nor has further legislation established what body placement, content, or artistic expressions should be disqualifiers. Not content to eviscerate the Second Amendment, the First is now deemed fair game. True, tear tattoos would be outside the experience of and off-putting to many private individuals, some of whom would no doubt choose to avoid anyone so inked. But imagine the “progressive” attacks against “intolerance” and worse, and the lawsuits that would result if gun (or any) manufacturers used that as criteria to discriminate and deny purchases of lawful products. “What about those tattoos?” lawyer John Sloan says the seller should have asked. “Why do you have those?” Closing the Tattoo Loophole is a standard he and the plaintiffs really want to advocate? Is that something Sloan would presume to ask a potential client? Gun owners tired of nosy ignoramuses demanding to know “why” they “need” this or that have an answer for grabbers like Sloan. It begins with “Because” and ends with “that’s why.”  About David Codrea: David Codrea is the winner of multiple journalist awards for investigating/defending the RKBA and a long-time gun owner rights advocate who defiantly challenges the folly of citizen disarmament.

ABSOLUTELY NOT…. The blame goes DIRECTLY on the person who’s finger pulled the trigger on a machine to make it fire, that machine can do NOTHING without a human finger operating the trigger, FACT ! The manufacturer has ZERO ability to know WHO is going to buy/steal their firearm/S/N’d parts. The federal background check is to weed out those who can or CANNOT buy their firearm/S/N’d parts. Obviously there are no checks and balances in place to weed out lying, say/do anything for money lawyers like Sloan. The intent behind the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act to to indemnify manufacturers from liability of legally supplying a product to someone who, later and unbeknownst to the manufacturer, uses that product in the commission of a crime. It does not matter whether the product is a weapon or not.

7429,https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-officer-sues-20200901-pojgbury4faqndrzy6zqv4cbvu-story.html,"Hartford police lieutenant alleges racial discrimination, retaliation in federal lawsuit against city","HARTFORD — A Black Hartford police lieutenant has accused the city, police chief and other high-ranking police officials of racial discrimination and retaliation in a new federal lawsuit. Paul West, an 18-year veteran of the department, filed the suit Aug. 19 against the city, Chief Jason Thody, four members of his command staff — Assistant Chief Rafael Medina, deputy chiefs Sonia Watson and Dustin Rendock and Capt. Ian Powell — and Lt. Kevin O’Brien. He sued Medina and Watson in both their professional and independent capacities. The suit is the latest of several attempts by West to seek redress for alleged mistreatment by the police administration, including its poor handling of another officer’s sexual harassment complaint and West being “repeatedly passed over for desirable assignments” because of his race. The federal lawsuit details many of the same allegations as a complaint West filed against the city in 2019 with the state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunity. His attorney Cynthia Jennings provided the complaint to The Courant in April 2019. West has been on extended leave from the Hartford Police Department since he was seriously injured in May 2019 while off duty. He was reportedly struck in the head with a baseball bat while trying to break up a fight near his home in Windsor. West alleges the retaliation stems from his handling of Officer Kelly Baerga’s sexual harassment complaint to the police administration in 2018, when West was the commanding officer of the recruitment division. Soon after West returned to Hartford from an out-of-state training, he attended a work event with the two recruitment officers, Baerga and Sgt. Andrew Rodney. There, he witnessed Rodney sexually harassing Baerga, the department’s LGBTQ liaison at the time, who reported the behavior to West. West made the formal complaint against Rodney, who was disciplined in September 2019 with a 35-day suspension. The 15-month investigation called into question the city’s outdated policies and the police department’s ability to handle sexual harassment complaints. Hartford adopted a new sexual harassment policy and complaint procedure in October 2019 that requires more training of employees and regular status updates for people who file complaints. However, West is still seeking a remedy to discrimination and retaliation he claims he faced after bringing the sexual harassment complaint to the administration, starting with his removal from the recruitment division. Soon after, West became seriously ill and was hospitalized, and states in the lawsuit that he had to ask a union representative to intervene to stop police officials from texting and calling him about when he planned to return to work. West also states that a police captain once told him over the phone “that the entire administration had something against Lt. West,” and that he was passed over for several promotions to captain or deputy chief. The lawsuit and pending CHRO complaint also detail an incident in December 2018 in which Medina allegedly “verbally berated” West at a crime scene and snapped his fingers and patted his thigh while calling for West, “in the vein of a dog being commanded to heel by its master’s side,” the complaint states. West submitted a complaint to human resources in November 2019, when the department was led by interim director Steven Francis. On June 25, West sent a memo to new human resources director Thulani LeGrier requesting an external investigation into his allegations. He did not describe the specific instances of discrimination or retaliation, and would not provide additional information to human resources, according to emails between LeGrier and West that were provided to The Courant. “It seems more like a position paper on his misgivings with Hartford PD than a formal complaint,” LeGreir said of the seven-page memo, in which West likens his inability to advance in the department to the May killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. “In human resources, we deal with employee-level, employee-related issues. If someone says the entire organization is suffering from systemic racism, well, we’re a staff of 12 people,” LeGrier said. “We don’t have the capacity to do that kind of investigation and it’s not specific enough to anchor a complain on to then go and do an investigation.” While West did state that he has experienced a hold on his pay and “continuous emotional and physical turmoil,” he would not respond when LeGrier asked him for specifics about his pay and any instances of workplace violence. The city does refer complaints to independent investigators, but LeGrier said it did not do so for West because he would cooperate with the preliminary investigation. “He categorically refused to engage in our standard process,” he said. On Aug. 3, West wrote to the city’s chief auditor, Craig Trujillo, requesting an investigation into both the police and human resources departments. Trujillo said Monday that his office is not taking up the complaint because it does not handle equal employment opportunity issues. West’s new attorney in the new case, Norm Pattis, did not respond to requests for comment.

7471,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/09/17/elec-s17.html,Trump repeats threats of post-election military repression as Barr calls for charging protesters with “sedition”,"Speaking at a White House press briefing Wednesday evening, President Trump reiterated his threats to call out the military and suppress election night demonstrations that might be provoked by a claim on his part to have won reelection. A reporter cited Attorney General William Barr’s statement that he wanted to charge anti-Trump demonstrators with sedition and Trump’s own previous comments about invoking the Insurrection Act, then asked him, “Why do you want to use that rhetoric?” Trump replied, “The question was asked to me if you have violent demonstrations. Yes, we will put it down quickly if there is. And I think the American public wants to see that.” He continued, “Look, if there’s any kind of demonstration or violence, there will be nothing that interferes with this product, this vote. There’s going to be nothing.” The question about Barr was based on a report by the Wall Street Journal that the attorney general had told federal prosecutors in a conference call last week that they should bring federal charges of insurrection against those who were arrested for violent actions during the wave of mass protests against police violence triggered by the May 25 police murder of George Floyd. According to this report, Barr went further, suggesting that some way be found to bring criminal charges against Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, a Democrat, because she did not immediately suppress a police-free protest zone in the city’s downtown for several weeks in June. After effectively endorsing Barr’s actions, Trump then launched into a lengthy diatribe against mail ballots, attempting, as he has on several other occasions, to distinguish between voting by absentee ballot, which he acknowledged doing regularly himself, and voting based on a mail-in system where state governments send ballots out widely to all registered voters. There is no difference in practice between absentee ballots and mail-in ballots, because in both cases state governments check the returned ballots against signatures on file. Trump falsely claimed that Democratic-controlled states were dropping the signature checking in order to manufacture large numbers of illegal votes against him. He has repeatedly claimed in recent days that the only way he can lose the election is due to vote-rigging. Wednesday’s remarks on mail-in voting were his most detailed and inflammatory comments on this issue. He claimed, “Our biggest threat to this election is governors from opposing parties controlling ballots, millions of ballots.” He continued, presenting an apocalyptic picture of the conduct of the November 3 election, “The ballots will be stolen. Who knows where they’re going? Who knows where they’re coming from? It’s not just the counting of the ballots, which by the way, which will take forever.” The most remarkable aspect of Trump’s 30-minute appearance is how easily the media let him avoid discussing the brazen threats of violence made by his own supporters. Only an hour before Trump took the podium in the White House press room, the top communications official in the Department of Health and Human Services, Michael Caputo, revealed he was taking a 60-day leave of absence, while his top assistant, Paul Alexander, would leave the agency permanently. Caputo had posted Sunday night a fascistic tirade on Facebook in which he accused scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of engaging in “sedition” against Trump. He also denounced supposed plans for a left-wing insurrection against Trump’s reelection, urged right-wing Trump supporters to stockpile ammunition for inauguration day, and called on his supporters to contact and join the New York Watchmen. Alexander came under heavy criticism last week when it was revealed that he had played a major role in censoring or doctoring CDC statements about the coronavirus in order to put Trump’s handling of the pandemic in a better political light. But aside from a passing reference by Trump to Caputo’s taking a leave of absence—which would take him out of the political spotlight until after the election—there was no discussion at the press briefing of the incitements to violence by various Trump aides and supporters. This includes the remarks by longtime political crony Roger Stone, who told the fascist broadcaster Alex Jones last week that Trump should declare martial law after the election and carry out a general roundup of his political enemies, including “the Clintons,” as well as the CEOs of major Silicon Valley companies. No reporter Wednesday even mentioned Stone’s name. While Trump and his political aides and advisers openly speak of civil war, martial law and armed attacks on their political opponents, the Democrats are largely ignoring and covering up the appeals for fascistic violence. Congressional Democrats have called for the ouster of Michael Caputo and his boss, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, but they have said nothing about the threats of postelection violence. Asked during a campaign swing Tuesday in Florida about the comments by Stone, Caputo and Trump himself, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said in an interview with Telemundo, “What is worrying is the way he talks about ‘insurrection’ and people taking up arms. Have you ever heard a Democratic president of the United States speak like this?” In subsequent comments, Biden bizarrely compared Trump to Fidel Castro as a would-be authoritarian ruler, in an effort to appeal to fascistic anti-Castro Cuban sentiment in south Florida, where Cuban Americans are the largest group of Hispanic voters. The Biden campaign’s Spanish-language advertising in Florida has struck an openly anticommunist note, portraying Trump as “soft” on Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela, in an effort to peel off traditionally Republican voters among Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans. Biden’s events in Florida also included an appearance before a group of veterans at Hillsborough County Community College in the Tampa area, where he attacked Trump for his reported slurs against soldiers killed or captured in US wars in the Middle East as “suckers” and “losers.” It was Biden’s first visit to the crucial “battleground” state since 2019. Besides appealing to the military and Cuban American vote, the former vice president is banking on the support of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who last week pledged to spend $100 million just in the Florida media markets in an effort to deliver the state and its 29 electoral votes to the Democratic ticket.

7603,https://www.essence.com/news/whataburger-employee-files-discrimination-complaint-racism/,Whataburger Employee Files Discrimination Complaint After Losing Job Over Black Lives Matter Mask,"Ma’Kiya Congious, a former employee at a Whataburger in Fort Worth, Texas, has filed a discrimination complaint against the company, alleging she lost her job because she wore a Black Lives Matter mask to work. According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the incident took place on Aug. 4. Congious was at work when, she says, a white woman complained about her Black Lives Matter mask. Congious notes that she had worn the mask before but had not experienced any issues until that day. In fact, she says, the district manager saw her in the parking lot when he arrived and did not say anything to her about the mask. This changed when the customer in question said she was going to call the restaurant’s corporate office to complain. According to the report, Congious was told the mask was inappropriate and that she could no longer wear it at work. “Whataburger wants you to wear masks that have no opinions whatsoever on them,” the manager is heard saying in a recording that Congious made. “You’re entitled to your personal opinions—that’s fine. But at Whataburger we don’t want to portray them, because some people may be offended. This is a big business…. Whataburger doesn’t want to get into anything political, because we’re just hamburgers and fries.” Congious, who said in her complaint that she was simply considering her options, asked the manager how she could request two weeks’ notice. The manager apparently wouldn’t grant her that. “You want to put your two weeks’ notice in? We accept it, and you don’t have to come back at all,” the manager said. Ultimately, the restaurant’s management called the police when Congious asked repeatedly what their response to her question meant. On Wednesday, Congious spoke about her case at a press conference, saying she wants to create change. In her complaint, she calls on Whataburger to allow Black Lives Matter masks; challenges the CEO to say “Black Lives Matter to Whataburger” on social media; and demands that the company provide more implicit bias training, among other initiatives. “It’s not a political thing,” Congious says about her mask. “It’s just a statement that says ‘Black Lives Matter,’ because we do matter.” “I do have a 5-month-old baby, and as he comes up in the world, I don’t want him to experience anything like this at all,” she adds. Whataburger released a statement saying that an employee “voluntarily resigned due to a disagreement over our company uniform policy.” A statement provided to ESSENCE notes that the company accepted said resignation and paid Congious for the upcoming two weeks she was scheduled to work. “Whataburger supports racial equality,” the company said in a previous statement to the Star-Telegram. “This is simply a matter of enforcing our uniform policy. Whataburger employees are provided company-issued masks that comply with our policy and adhere to CDC and local government guidance.” According to the Star-Telegram, the company policy, which doesn’t mention political statements, only mandates “plain or work-appropriate patterned bandanas or other cloth material.” “Federal and state laws make it illegal to discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of their employment because of their race and color. We believe that’s what the evidence will show Whataburger did when they mistreated Ma’Kiya for wearing a ‘Black Lives Matter’ mask,” Congious’ lawyer, Jason Smith, says.

7630,https://la.eater.com/2020/9/16/21439899/chateau-marmont-sexual-misconduct-andre-balazs-hotel-los-angeles-drugs-racial-discrimination,"Report Alleges Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination at Chateau Marmont","Filed under: A Hollywood Reporter story, out this morning, paints a bleak picture of life at one of LA’s most vaunted celebrity hospitality hideouts The trouble continues for one of Los Angeles’s most iconic hospitality and restaurant destinations. Chateau Marmont, the Sunset Strip hangout known for celebrities, not-so-well-hidden debauchery, and the annual Jay-Z and Beyoncé post-Oscar party, is now under fire from Hollywood Reporter writer and restaurant critic Gary Baum. In a scathing story with nearly three-dozen sources, Baum puts forward a number of ruinous allegations against the Chateau Marmont and owner André Balazs, ranging from sexual misconduct claims and overt discrimination to “neglectful management” and union-busting. In the massive story up now on Hollywood Reporter, titled Rot at Hollywood’s “Playground,” Baum begins by alleging that multi-millionaire hotelier owner Balazs — who also owns the Mercer in New York and the Chiltern Firehouse in London — only announced plans earlier this summer to turn the hotel into a private members-only club as a way to lay off staff and keep employees from forming a union. The move sounds similar to the Augie’s Coffee issue from back in July, though Balazs denies that this was the impetus for making any changes. From there, the story winds into the troubling lives of many lower-level hotel staff members, including a decade-long housekeeper named Sonia Molina Sanchez who says that Balazs and higher-level employees did nothing when she complained of overtly sexual behavior from a male hotel guest. Another employee, Adrian Jules, says that a fellow employee sent sexually suggestive texts to him, but that the company lacked a formal human resources department and thus nothing was done when he raised the issue with higher-ups. Balazs is to blame directly for much of the culture at Chateau Marmont, says Baum. Ultra-special VIPs who were close with Balazs would demand to keep drinking after the 2 a.m. legal cutoff, and would threaten the employment of staff members if told no. Balazs himself is described as “an alcoholic, drug-addicted father” by one anonymous staff member, and the Hollywood Reporter alleges multiple instances of sexual misconduct and abuse by him over the years, including at the Standard hotel, which he also opened. A highly public groping incident involving actress Amanda Anka (that ended in husband Jason Bateman reportedly spitting his gum in Balazs’ face) made the rounds in 2017, but other incidents resulted only in confidential settlements. There’s a lot more to the Hollywood Reporter story, including quotes from many longtime former employees about BIPOC discrimination in staffing, drug-fueled parties that destroyed rooms and left staff scrambling to clean up, and the recent struggles of the property (including rooms being available for rent on Expedia before the pandemic). Here’s one example: Employees portray the hotel as an institution defined by racial prejudice. It starts, they say, with Balazs himself, a micro-managerial personality who they perceive has a clear preference in hiring and promoting white workers “on the floor,” hospitality speak for high-visibility roles, and that managers are so cognizant of hewing to it that they shift staff when he’s on site to appease him, and have even called in certain employees on their days off who best fit his favored aesthetic. It’s also worth noting that the adjacent closed restaurant Bar Marmont is also discussed, as writer Baum alleges that Balazs had planned to turn the building into a private sex-themed party space, where attendees would be told to leave their cell phones in locked boxes and the entrance itself was emblazoned with “a brass phallus doorknob [that] was removed after hotel employees complained.” It’s important to note that Balazs, through his PR firm and his lawyers, deny most everything in the Hollywood Reporter story, particularly the diversity issues and sexual impropriety claims.

Author: Courtney Taylor September 25, 2020 September 2020  Olivia Murry is a senior at Next Steps at Vanderbilt. Though she is taking a deferment year from the inclusive higher education program during the COVID-19 pandemic, she remains connected and committed to disability education and advocacy. In July, Olivia was invited to serve as a panelist for a webinar briefing sponsored by the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD). The CCD is a coalition of national organizations working together to advocate for federal public policy that ensures the self-determination, independence, empowerment, integration, and inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of society. The briefing was held to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). It gave Olivia an opportunity to share more about Next Steps and her college experiences and goals, and to celebrate the impact that the ADA has had in her life. The CCD’s Education Taskforce hosted the briefing, which was presented in collaboration with Senator Bob Casey, Congressman Mark Desaulnier, Congressman Jim Langevin, and Congressman Don Young. In the webinar and in the interview below, Olivia talks about her college classes, internships, and shares a speech she wrote on disability discrimination for her Public Speaking class. Next Steps at Vanderbilt University is a four-year program for individuals with intellectual disability. It allows me to attend college and have a full college experience. While at college, I attend Vanderbilt classes, learn new things, and get to know my classmates and professors. For each of my Vanderbilt classes, I have an Independent Learning Agreement (ILA) that my advisor develops with my professors. This ILA is a revised syllabus that outlines the assignments and projects I will complete. Having an ILA allows me to access unique classes at Vanderbilt including Songwriting, History of Fashion, Introduction to Archaeology, Southeast Asia Studies, and many others. I also meet weekly with peer mentors, known as “Ambassadores.” Ambassadores help me with my classes, stay organized, and get involved in Vanderbilt’s campus life opportunities. Another important part of Next Steps is career development. We explore different career options and have internships each semester to develop our professionalism and build our resumes. During my time at Vanderbilt, I have interned with the Vanderbilt Owen School of Business, the Human Resources office at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the Vanderbilt Admissions Office, the scheduling and archiving department for Governor Bill Lee, and the Nashville District Attorney’s Office. These internships have helped me stay motivated, explore different career options, build my office administration skills, and gain workplace independence. During my internships, I receive support from job coaches. My job coaches support me to gain greater workplace independence, meet career goals, and develop needed workplace supports. When I graduate from Vanderbilt, I am interested in working in a government office, in human resources, or as an administrative assistant for the Nashville Predators hockey team. Inclusion. I picked the speech for my Public Speaking class because my dad helped me to decide about it. I was going to write about something else. My professor liked it, too, because it was important to me. A lot of people don’t know about the hard experiences of people with disabilities. And that they should be able to experience college and get good jobs, too. In my speech, I wanted to educate my classmates about disability discrimination and things that should be done to improve it. About employment and jobs. I told them only 26 states out of 50 states have seen job gains for people who have disabilities since 2016. People who have disabilities are the largest minority group in the country and are usually dedicated, and they don’t leave jobs as often as people who don’t have disabilities. People who have disabilities have a work ethic, and they work hard and want to be proud of their accomplishments. But sometimes their work ethics are different than what most people think. Disabled people can be more capable and talented than some people think.

7663,https://www.pittsburghcurrent.com/inmates-with-mental-illness-suing-allegheny-county-jail-for-discrimination-mistreatment/,"Inmates with mental illness suing Allegheny County Jail for discrimination, mistreatment - Pittsburgh Current"," By Matt Petras Pittsburgh Current Contributing Writer info@pittsburghcurrent.com Five Allegheny County Jail inmates are suing the facility for discriminatory and cruel treatment against incarcerated persons with mental illness and for inadequate mental health treatment, including the use of solitary confinement and restraint chairs. These individuals, Shaquille Howard, James Byrd, Jason Porter, Keisha Cohen and Albert Castaphany, are suing both on their own behalf as well as on the behalf of all other ACJ inmates with mental illness. Chief Deputy Warden of Healthcare Services Laura Williams, Warden of ACJ Orlando Harper, Mental Health Director Michael Barfield and the county have been named as the defendants in the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the ACJ violated the 14th Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act for a slew of misconduct against inmates with mental illnesses. According to the lawsuit, ACJ used solitary confinement, tasers and restraint chairs to control inmates with psychiatric disabilities instead of offering appropriate mental health treatment. It raises news coverage, such as a 2015 Washington Post story reporting that the Pennsylvania prison system announced it will no longer put inmates with mental illness in solitary confinement. The inmates also accused ACJ of being understaffed regarding mental healthcare and called attention to its lack of individual and group counseling or therapy services. The lawsuit posits that providing such mental healthcare is a bare minimum requirement for jails. Included in the lawsuit are specific accounts from the five inmates, who have mental health concerns like bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. About 44% of ACJ’s population of more than 2,000 inmates have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and more than a quarter have serious physiological issues, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics information cited in the lawsuit. One of the plaintiffs, Howard, has been incarcerated at ACJ since June 2017 and suffers from PTSD and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression, according to the lawsuit. Howard is said to have spent more than half of his time at ACJ in solitary confinement, during which he “spent about 23 hours a day in a tiny, dirty, concrete cell, with little to no opportunity for human interaction, exercise or recreation.” He was also said to have been placed in a restraint chair with mace on his face without food, drink, medication or bathroom breaks. A medication he uses to treat his PTSD is also said to have been discontinued without notice or explanation. The lawsuit alleges an officer encouraged him to commit suicide after his repeated requests for treatment were ignored. In February of 2020, Howard attempted to hang himself while in solitary confinement. The lawsuit contains similar allegations of inmates with mental illness being denied treatment, held in solitary confinement and restrained in chairs. Some inmates have urinated or defecated while in restraint chairs, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit draws attention to the disproportionate incarceration of Black people in ACJ, where Black individuals make up 67 percent of the jail’s population despite representing only 13.4 percent of the county’s population. “In Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, the overwhelming brunt of the conditions of incarceration at ACJ is born by the Black community,” according to the lawsuit.

7758,https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/metis-federation-alleges-systemic-discrimination-during-manitoba-s-covid-19-response-1.5101948,Metis Federation alleges 'systemic discrimination' during Manitoba's COVID-19 response,"Follow on Advertisement Devon McKendrick Digital Editorial Producer @the_dmckendrick Contact MMF president David Chartrand WINNIPEG -- The Manitoba Metis Federation (MMF) announced on Friday that the organization has sent a letter to the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, alleging systemic discrimination against the Metis people throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter was sent as a complaint against the Manitoba government, Cameron Friesen, the minister of Health, Seniors and Active Living, and Dr. Brent Roussin, the province's chief provincial public health officer. The MMF said the complaint states the organization has faced discrimination and systemic discrimination throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. David Chartrand, who is the president of the MMF, said the government has been unwilling to work with the Metis nation, despite working with other Indigenous people in the province. He noted the federation had contact with the government in early April as it wanted to enter into a data-sharing agreement with the province allowing it to confirm the identity of Metis citizens. Chartrand said the problem the federation faced was he claims the province said self-identification wasn't ""sufficient evidence"" of being Metis. ""We have a database of over 50,000 Metis citizens in our database. So when you start looking at it from that context, we have a very vast amount of knowledge of where our people live, their families, and who they are,"" said Chartrand. He said First Nations carry treaty cards for identification, adding he feels it is unfair the government won't work with the MMF because if the identification issue. ""Dr. Roussin is a doctor, first he has an obligation. But more importantly, the premier and the minister of health have an obligation for all Manitobans, not a selected few,"" said Chartrand. He said he feels like the Metis are being punished for disagreements in the past. The MMF said there have been repeated efforts to get in contact with the government from April to August. The MMF said on Thursday it did receive a letter from minister Friesen to start a discussion but Chartrand said the letter will not stop the Human Right complaint. In an emailed statement to CTV News, a spokesperson for the province said, ""The claims made by Manitoba Métis Federation President David Chartrand are unfortunate and have no basis in fact. The Government of Manitoba has already signed information sharing agreements with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Manitoba Inuit Association and has repeatedly indicated that we are open to developing a similar agreement with the Manitoba Métis Federation. Contrary to the assertions of the MMF, the province has reached out to encourage the development of an information sharing agreement and provincial officials have been regularly engaged with staff from the MMF regarding COVID-19."" The statement also said the priority of the government is the health and safety of all Manitobans and that it encourages the MMF to engage with provincial health officials.

7822,https://hongkongfp.com/2020/09/15/let-reason-drive-hong-kongs-covid-19-policy-debates-not-discrimination/,"Let reason drive Hong Kong's Covid-19 policy debates, not discrimination | Hong Kong Free Press HKFP","Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non-profit Recently, a restaurant reportedly posted a notice saying that it would not serve customers who have taken part in the Hong Kong government’s Universal Community Testing Programme (UCTP). Whether you are a UCTP sceptic or supporter, consider, for the moment, resisting the urge to toe the party line and to base your position about the incident on an “us versus them” mindset. Instead, why don’t we break down the issues, see what the law says, and apply it as it is? The facts: the notice claimed that UCTP participants were likely to have been infected with Covid-19, and that they have an “intelligence quotient lower than 65” and therefore would not be able to appreciate the “high quality” of the food served by the restaurant. Hence the policy to turn them away. Is this a case of unlawful disability discrimination? The underlying issues are: (i) whether infection with Covid-19 is a disability; (ii) whether having an “intelligence quotient lower than 65” is a disability; (iii) whether being perceived as Covid-19 carriers or people with the said intelligence level (even when this is not true) amounts to having a “disability” from the perspective of relevant laws; (iv) whether rejecting customers based on these perceptions constitutes unlawful disability discrimination; and (v) whether there is any exemption in relation to infectious diseases. The answers to all these questions lie in the Disability Discrimination Ordinance. Its definition of “disability” is perhaps wider than many would imagine. It includes the “presence in the body of organisms capable of causing disease or illness” (e.g. viruses like Covid-19), and the total or partial loss of a person’s “mental functions” (e.g. a limited intellectual capacity, phrased in the notice as an “intelligence quotient lower than 65”). Notably, the definition not only covers disability that currently or actually exists but also disability that is “imputed” to a person, i.e. thought or assumed to exist in that person, as in the case of the said notice. Under the Disability Discrimination Ordinance, it is unlawful for a restaurant, or any service provider for that matter, to treat its customers less favourably on the ground of disability, whether real or imputed. Although the law provides an exception for discrimination based on an infectious disease listed under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance (e.g. Covid-19), it applies only where the discriminatory act is “reasonably necessary” to protect public health. A decisive issue, then, is whether refusing to serve UCTP participants based on the assumption that they are likely to have been infected with Covid-19 constitutes a “reasonably necessary” measure for the purpose of protecting public health. Notwithstanding the accusations among untrusting citizens about the UCTP’s cost-effectiveness and data-handling procedures, there is no evidential proof supporting the assumption that participants are susceptible to contracting Covid-19 during the testing process. It follows that the exemption is unlikely to be applicable here. As for assuming that certain customers have an “intelligence quotient below 65” and consequently turning them away, the exemption again does not apply for an all-too-obvious reason: a loss of mental functions is not an infectious disease. Plainly put, it is unlawful for a restaurant to reject customers because they believe them to be of a lesser intellectual level. While no one has yet come forward to the Equal Opportunities Commission with a complaint about the restaurant’s notice, we earnestly hope that the public will not condone such a blatant encouragement of discriminatory attitudes and practices. From calling Covid-19 the “Wuhan virus” and “Kung Flu” to ridiculing political opponents who have been infected with the coronavirus (in one instance a patient was openly mocked by a news report as a “virus queen” after having contracted the virus and possibly transmitting it to family members), it is now apparent that many of the debates surrounding governments’ responses to the pandemic, both in Hong Kong and globally, are conducted at times through needlessly divisive, discriminatory, and stigmatising language. While the threshold for the offence of “vilification” under the Disability Discrimination Ordinance and Race Discrimination Ordinance is high – it involves engaging in a public activity that incites “hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule” against a person on the grounds of disability or race – the spirit of the law is clear: the freedom of speech or opinion, though seen by many (misguidedly) as an absolute right, should not override the right to equality and non-discrimination. Of course, there will always be debates about public policies, Covid-related or otherwise. They are invaluable insofar as they are accurately informed and help refine policymaking. But when we allow conversations to be coloured by discriminatory language, and reason to give way to recrimination, we inevitably lose focus and, along with it, potential allies. We must do better than this.

7844,https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/williamson-county/former-williamson-county-detective-suing-for-discrimination-live-pd-appearances/269-1604dec9-084a-4106-8c51-348c2462782d,Former Williamson County detective sues over discrimination,"WILLIAMSON COUNTY, Texas — A former deputy is suing the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office, claiming its leaders discriminated against her for being a woman and for forcing her to appear on a reality TV show. Heather Vargas, a former undercover narcotics detective, worked with the department for seven years until she was fired in September 2019 for allegedly violating the department’s social media policy. According to the lawsuit, Vargas admitted to posting a meme on Facebook with a caption that read, “[expletive] be 37 stressing over some [n-word] born in 1999.” Vargas claims her male coworkers, including a lieutenant, had made posts on social media using similar language yet never faced any suspension, discipline or termination. RELATED: Williamson County detective reportedly fired over racial Facebook post Williamson County sheriff says social media policy is too vague to punish commander over posts “The meme Vargas posted was completely consistent with both the work culture of WCSO and her personal lifestyle, and it was no different than hundreds of other memes Vargas and numerous other WCSO law enforcement officers had previously posted or re-posted on social media over the previous few years,” her attorney wrote. It was Vargas’ first Facebook post, the lawsuit alleges, since an anonymous Twitter account had exposed comments made by a WCSO sergeant about Vargas’ breasts earlier that month. During a meeting with an internal affairs detective about the meme Vargas had posted, she called out the sergeant who wrote the comments for sexually harassing her and accused the sheriff’s office for tolerating it and “fostering and feeding a misogynistic and sexually harassing culture.” Vargas claims she faced suspension and eventual termination as retaliation for the anonymous Twitter posts that exposed the sergeant’s inappropriate comments about her. Vargas also claims in July 2018 she was approached by department leaders, including Sheriff Robert Chody, to appear on “Live PD Presents: Women on Patrol.” RELATED: How Sheriff Robert Chody hired, promoted deputies with tarnished badges She immediately declined, according to the lawsuit, because she feared appearing on a TV show would “[expose] her identity and threaten her undercover work and her safety.” However, later that month, Vargas claims she was pulled into an office with four male supervisors and told she did not have a choice and that she will appear on the show. Vargas also alleges that, later that month, a coworker told her that a department leader was overheard saying she was forced to appear on the TV show because she “‘looked good and [her] good looks would get good ratings for the agency.’” Vargas appeared on the show between August and October 2018, according to the lawsuit, despite her complaints. Her appearance caused her “extreme stress over the next year.” As part of her lawsuit, Vargas is asking that a judge order WCSO to stop its leaders from retaliating against other employees who file sexual harassment complaints. She’s also asking that a judge order WCSO to “carry out policies, particles and programs which provide equal employment opportunities for all employees.” Vargas also wants her job back and back pay. In response to the lawsuit, Williamson County Chief Deputy Tim Ryle sent KVUE the following statement: ""The episode involving the off-duty conduct of an employee and comments and depictions with the 'elf on a shelf' revealed that the social media policy of the Sheriff’s office needed to be more restrictive. That policy was changed to prohibit this type of activity. All employees received the new policy and acknowledged their receipt. This employee made a choice to post the [meme] after she knew the policy prohibited such behavior. The employee had been previously counseled about complaints filed on images she posted which also brought discredit and she has now been separated from employment as a result of her behavior. The remaining issues in the filing lack key facts, is inaccurate and the Sheriff’s Office looks forward to revealing that information in the upcoming legal proceedings. We have no further comments on this pending litigation."" You can read a full copy of the lawsuit below.

7883,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/09/nicaragua-gobierno-pareciera-preparar-nueva-fase-represion/,Nicaragua: Ortega government appears to be preparing for a new phase of repression,"In light of the recent presentation of the Law for the Regulation of Foreign Agents and the Special Law on Cyber-crime before Nicaragua’s National Assembly, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said: “After several weeks of intensified state repression against activists, human rights defenders and journalists, the ruling party presented two bills that attempt to silence those who criticize government policies, inform the population and defend human rights. It seems that President Daniel Ortega’s government is preparing the legal framework to begin a new phase of repression.” “The new legislation was presented by the ruling party days after the president expressed interest in initiating a reform to establish life imprisonment, which could be used to punish those who raise their voices against repressive policies. People should not be sanctioned for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association. Once again, we call on the government to end the repression. We will not stop denouncing it.” “In a country where press freedom and the defence of human rights are under continuous attack, the international community must be energetic in condemning these events and demanding that the government, once and for all, guarantee the human rights of the population.” For more information or to arrange an interview, contact Duncan Tucker: duncan.tucker@amnesty.org If you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you.

7935,http://www.fightbacknews.org/2020/9/22/resist-us-government-repression-build-revolutionary-movement,"Resist U.S. government repression, build a revolutionary movement","Across the country the U.S. government is unleashing a wave of repression attempting to criminalize those who protest against police killings of Black men and other oppressed people. We call on people to resist the repression and to build towards revolution by organizing more mass protests and joining groups like the Freedom Road Socialist Organization. After the gruesome police strangulation of George Floyd, a mass uprising in Minneapolis, with tens of thousands, led to the fiery destruction of the 3rd Precinct police station. It gave the rich rulers of this country a much needed jolt. The Floyd rebellion then spurred widespread protests in hundreds of cities, even reaching suburbs and small-town America. Millions participated in protests against police killings and judicial impunity, demanding community control of the police and the defunding of police budgets. People are not taking it anymore and are fighting back. In response, the police consciously plan their attacks using teargas, clubs, rubber bullets - long with other ‘nonlethal’ projectiles that maim and take out eyes - and even gunfire. The politicians are the ones who order and direct the police repression, provoking angry responses from protesters, knowing what the results will be. Let us be clear, the politicians are our main target. Politicians need to make the reforms we are demanding. At the top, President Trump directs the repression from the White House and it is carried out by the Department of Homeland Security, coordinating with governors and city mayors, both Republicans and Democrats. Portland, Oregon is a good example. The militant months-long sustained rebellion there has resulted in at least 74 people under federal charges. In Portland, Trump had DHS direct a combined force of federal forces and departments. These federal police stalked protesters on the streets, pulled them into unmarked vans, and locked them away. These same federal officers hunted down and killed anti-racist activist Michael Rienoehl, whose only crime was self-defense against a right-wing extremist who threatened him. Then there is Kenosha, Wisconsin, where cops shot Jacob Blake in the back and paralyzed him. Again, the police response to protesters was to launch teargas and physically attack thousands of people, to violently drive them away from chanting and rallying outside the local courthouse. The same police let a white supremacist who shot and killed two protesters walk right through their lines, fully armed. A week later President Trump praised these police and their murderous collusion. There are many examples, but two more stand out: the police collusion with a white supremacist in Tallahassee, Florida, leading to the police banning of street protests and multiple arrests, and the federally-coordinated arrests of anti-racist activists in Denver. It is clear, the U.S. government is repressing the widespread and insistent movement to stop police killings. We want to share some lessons the Freedom Road Socialist Organization learned from our past experience with FBI Repression ten years ago. Lessons from the Antiwar 23 On September 24, 2010, the Antiwar 23 were raided by the FBI and subpoenaed to appear in front of a grand jury on allegations of ‘material support for terrorism.’ By mobilizing a mass movement, the Antiwar 23 beat back the U.S. government political repression. We owe a debt of gratitude to our many friends across the U.S. who helped us fight back and win. Solidarity! In Minneapolis and Chicago, over 70 FBI agents stormed into people’s homes, breaking things and overturning movement leaders’ lives. The FBI carted out boxes of books, newspapers, notebooks, poetry journals and children’s artwork, removed photographs and paintings off the wall, along with computers, laptops, cell phones and passports. The FBI loaded them into vans and drove them away to comb through every detail of people’s lives and activism. The U.S. government aimed to put anti-war activists, labor unionists and student activists in prison on multiple charges, each carrying 15 years. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, the FBI followed and subpoenaed two more activists. This was a nationwide sweep, where the FBI knocked on doors in Durham, North Carolina; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and San Jose, California asking questions. They did not get far. All refused to speak to the FBI or to appear at the grand jury. The Antiwar 23 lesson is clear: Do not speak to the FBI. You are required to give your name, but then tell them to contact your lawyer. Do not speak to the FBI or any law enforcement. Abolish the grand jury In the months after the FBI raids, the Antiwar 23 refused the grand jury. The grand jury system is rigged to benefit the wealthy rulers of this country. If you really want to abolish something, this is it. At a grand jury, the prosecutor is the one asking you questions and you are not allowed a lawyer. Once you speak, you are not allowed to refuse to answer questions, or you can be jailed. It is a terrible, one-sided system that is regularly abused. Resistance is key. Resisting the grand jury means not speaking at all, knowing you might have to sit in jail. A few years ago there were heroic anarchist friends in the Northwest who sat in jail for months instead of testifying. The prosecutor can jail you to coerce you to speak, but not forever. Prosecutors abuse the grand jury in the other direction too. It is the same grand jury system that lets off killer cops. We say, “Abolish the grand jury!” Dump ‘material support’ laws The U.S. government uses ‘material support for terrorism’ charges to choke off free speech, curb freedom of association, and to lock people up. Many of the Antiwar 23 are members of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization. All of the 23 were part of very open and public campaigns in solidarity with liberation movements in Palestine, the Philippines and Colombia. Freedom Road’s newspaper, Fight Back! regularly reports on the heroic efforts of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the political prisoner Simon Trinidad of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) being held in the Colorado supermax prison. The FRSO stands for proletarian internationalism and for solidarity with the oppressed against their U.S. oppressors. We won’t back down. The FRSO upholds the slogan “Revolution, Socialism and Liberation.” There is no doubt the U.S. government and its Wall Street bosses are threatened by these ideas. That is why the FBI and the courts kept us tied up for eight years, and then they went after our closest comrades. Sheriffs raided the home of Chicano leader Carlos Montes in Los Angeles. Montes faced trumped-up charges but we defeated the case against him by speaking out and organizing. Then the U.S. government arrested an icon of the Palestinian liberation movement, Rasmea Odeh. An organizer of Arab women in Chicago, Odeh was forced to depart the U.S. after an almost four-year struggle that put Israeli crimes on trial and lifted up the cause for Palestinian liberation. Let us not forget the 500 or so American Muslims framed by the FBI and other agencies using ‘material support’ laws as part of the phony U.S. ‘War on Terror.’ The FBI and prosecutors continue to use paid informants to frame up people. In many cases, they pretend to be your friend. They tried to do this to the Antiwar 23. It is especially treacherous and ugly. Solidarity wins! For the FRSO, we act in solidarity with the workers and oppressed people of the world against U.S. imperialism. We say Wall Street finance companies and banks have no right to rule workers in this country, let alone the peoples of other countries. The billionaire class that dominates this country is on the road to ruin. We need to replace the dictatorship of rich with the rule of the working class and its allies. Black, Chicano and the Hawai'ian oppressed nations have the right to self-determination. Sovereignty and national development for Native Americans and other indigenous people! Independence for Puerto Rico and other U.S. colonies! This is the future, and we can advance toward it quickly - if we resist U.S. government repression and organize to push forward our movements now! Organize to win! Do not speak to the FBI or police. Refuse to testify at the grand jury. Solidarity! Buy a copy of Frank Chapman's autobiography, The Damned Don't Cry, from Changemaker Press  ""Working with Frank over the past five years, I have seen something that highlights the importance of this book. In his role leading the struggle for community control of the Chicago police, Frank instantly commands the respect and trust of those in and around the movement who have been wrongfully convicted or who have wrongfully convicted family members in prison. When he points the way forward, they believe in him. This book will only cement further the status he has in their struggle."" -- Joe Iosbaker   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The document alleges that Mauldin told Michael the station had “every intention” of renegotiating the agreement, but the news anchor was asked to wait until after the February sweeps period because it was occupying all of Mauldin’s time. “As a courtesy to Mauldin, Mr. Michael agreed and waited in good faith,” the suit states.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-urbanhollywood411_com-box-4-0')}; Michael alleges the stress of waiting for a new contract became so severe that in April 2019, his news director had to take him to a hospital, and he was kept overnight because of a “potential heart attack.” A short time later, KCBS hired Jay Howell as the new GM.

8088,https://www.icj.org/philippines-icj-co-hosts-webinar-series-on-the-elimination-of-discrimination-against-women-in-the-legal-profession/,Philippines: ICJ co-hosts Webinar Series on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in the Legal Profession,"Connect with us on social media or subscribe to our news feed to receive regular updates.  On 29 August and 5 September, the ICJ collaborated with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to hold a webinar series for legal aid providers in the Philippines on eliminating gender discriminatory attitudes and behaviors towards women.  Members of IBP’s legal aid committees from the Eastern and Western Mindanao Regions participated in these webinars, focused on gender stereotypes and discriminatory practices that exist in the legal profession and in the work of legal aid providers who directly engage with women when they seek justice. Dato Ambiga Sreenevasan, ICJ’s Commissioner from Malaysia, addressed the promotion and protection of women’s human rights in the context of the legal profession: “While conditions for women have improved, there is still work to be done to achieve equality between men and women in the legal profession. At the entry level, things appear to be going well, but we must look also at women’s opportunities throughout their legal career and question why it is the case that some areas are still male-dominated.” Mikiko Otani, ICJ’s Commissioner from Japan and a member of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, spoke about how gender stereotypes and gender discrimination hinder women from accessing justice. “The Bar should be at the forefront of advocating for improvement in legal structures that would help eliminate gender discrimination,” she said. The Philippines had previously featured as one of the top ten performers in addressing gender disparities, as measured by the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index. However, it has recently fallen to rank 16th out of 153 countries. Emerlynne Gil, ICJ Senior International Legal Adviser, acknowledged various measures adopted by the Philippines to implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), such as the adoption of the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act and the Magna Carta for Women. She noted, however, that the Philippines still must do a great deal more. “The existing culture of impunity and lack of effective remedies for women to access the justice system are just some of the difficult challenges the country faces that prevent it from achieving this goal,” Emerlynne Gil said. The webinar series also featured a discussion on specific challenges faced by women when accessing justice during the COVID 19 pandemic and in the context of the “drug war” in the Philippines. The lawyers discussed their role and also that of the Bar as an institution to immediately identify and eliminate these gender stereotypes to ensure their clients’ right to access to justice. Judge Amy Alabado Avellano, a Regional Trial Court judge in the Philippines led this discussion. Attorney Burt Estrada, IBP Executive Vice President, and Attorney Marienne Ibadlit, former IBP Governor for Western Visayas, also held a dialogue with the lawyers on how the IBP as a professional association for lawyers in the Philippines could contribute towards enhancing access to justice for women in the country.

8178,https://www.vox.com/2020/10/5/21427881/paycheck-protection-program-black-owned-businesses,The Paycheck Protection Program failed many Black-owned businesses,"It built on inequities that already exist in banking. Danielle Parker, the CEO of Detroit Maid, says her business almost didn’t make it this past spring. Parker’s company — which provides on-demand cleaning services — is among those that have been forced to completely alter their business model as a result of social distancing and public health guidelines during the pandemic. While Detroit Maid had previously focused 80 percent of its work on residential clients, the company has now shifted to operating predominantly with commercial ones. Because of how much business slowed, Parker’s staff was cut roughly in half earlier this year, and at one point, she didn’t know if they’d stay open. “Businesses like mine, we had severe loss in staff, and we weren’t sure if we were going to be able to make it through May,” she told Vox. There have been some sources of help, though. Roughly $35,000 in local grants from regional groups like TechTown and Invest Detroit have been major lifelines as Parker’s business has adapted. ”We went from not knowing if we were going to survive ... to pivoting pretty quickly,” Parker says. Federal support, however, was more challenging to access. Parker is one of millions of business owners who applied to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) — a federal effort to boost small businesses established by the CARES Act — and she’s also among those who was denied support with little explanation why. “They said we didn’t meet the criteria, and they didn’t specify,” she said, adding that PayPal — the company she applied through — was very responsive, even though the process itself was cumbersome. “When I got the result back, I was like, I wonder if I just didn’t do it right — especially because there wasn’t a specific reason.” Parker is far from the only business owner who’s dealt with confusion related to the program, and her experience underscores just how much it failed many small businesses. PayPal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to August survey results that the advocacy group Small Business Majority provided to Vox, the program appeared to reach a lower proportion of Black-owned businesses in particular. In that poll, 23 percent of Black business owners who did not receive PPP or Economic Injury Disaster Loans said their PPP applications were denied, compared to 9 percent of white business owners, 13 percent of Latino business owners, and 9 percent of Asian American business owners. And in Michigan overall, only 3 restaurants that received PPP loans of $150,000 or more self-identified as Black-owned, compared to 223 that self-identified as white-owned, according to the Detroit Free Press. It’s worth noting that the current demographic data that’s available on PPP is incomplete because business owners were not required to submit this information when they applied, and roughly 75 percent of businesses did not do so. The Small Business Administration has also emphasized that the average loan size in the program was around $100,000, an indicator that it helped serve smaller businesses. Because minority-owned businesses are smaller, on average, this could mean that they benefited strongly from the program. Independent survey results and analyses of the geographic distribution of PPP loans, meanwhile, have highlighted some disparities. An analysis by the New York Fed’s Claire Kramer Mills and Jessica Battisto found that multiple counties with high amounts of Black business receipts including Wayne County, Michigan — where Detroit is located — and Prince George’s County, Maryland, were among those to see lower rates of PPP allocation. In Wayne County, where more than a third of businesses are Black-owned, just 12.9 percent of businesses obtained loans, while 18.9 percent of businesses nationwide did per an updated review Kramer Mills and Battisto shared with Vox, which includes August data released by SBA. These gaps were driven by a couple of factors including systemic inequities in banking, a chaotic application process that overwhelmed many small businesses, and restrictive terms on the loans that put off some business owners from pursuing them at all. The distribution of PPP was among the factors the New York Fed researchers examined in trying to understand why an estimated 41 percent of Black-owned small businesses became inactive during the early months of the pandemic, more than double the 17 percent of white-owned businesses that did. “Access to capital and money has always been an issue with respect to Black enterprise, that’s nothing new,” says Rev. Horace Sheffield, the head of the Detroit Association of Black Organizations. “The pandemic has exposed or exacerbated that disparity.” The role that big banks had in the program — particularly early on — posed a huge obstacle for many small businesses especially in the first wave of funding. Rather than applying to the Small Business Administration directly, businesses were required to pursue the PPP through a third-party lender, including a bank, credit union, or fintech company like PayPal. That lender would then play a role in approving the application for a business to move forward. According to the SBA data released in August, lenders with assets of $10 billion or more were responsible for 47 percent of the loans that were made, a sign that larger lenders — including banks — had a strong presence in the program. The top three lenders in the program, per the agency, were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and PNC, comprising just over 10 percent of loans. Lawmakers worked to ameliorate access issues in the second wave of funding, which contained a $60 billion set-aside for community development financial institutions and other entities that work with underbanked communities, including rural and minority-owned businesses. “The big challenge is finding a lender. The banks have been inundated,” says Sheffield, who notes that this is where multiple businesses got held up. “Some of their applications got caught up in the queue, didn’t necessarily go through, and the bank had their own vetting process.” As PPP got underway this past spring, many large banks declined to take applications from anyone who wasn’t already a customer. Bank of America, Chase, and TD Bank were just a few that limited the applications they would accept to customers who had prior accounts or lines of credit. And while they were likely doing this for volume control and their own review purposes, that meant that business owners who did not have an established relationship with these institutions would effectively be barred from pursuing PPP through them. “TD Bank’s existing customers with a business deposit account or loan were eligible to apply for the PPP through the bank,” a TD Bank spokesperson said. “To support our PPP lending process, TD digitized the SBA’s application and strove to provide equal access to the funds by only accepting applications through our digital portal and by keeping the application open throughout June and July.” “In July, we expanded who could apply for a PPP loan through us. We opened it to people who only have a business credit card with us, or who told us they own a business but only have a personal checking account with us,” a Chase spokesperson told Vox. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although businesses were able to apply for the loans through community development financial institutions, community banks, and tech companies, as well as other outlets, the restrictions imposed by larger banks cut off many from one key source for the program. “Initially, PPP really fortified banking pipes to disburse funds in communities,” Kramer Mills told Vox. The program’s reliance on banking is one that disproportionately hurt Black-owned businesses, the New York Fed report found. According to that report, “1 in 4 Black-owned employer firms [had] a recent borrowing relationship with a bank” prior to the pandemic, while 1 in 10 Black-owned non-employer firms did. Because an overwhelming majority of Black-owned businesses are non-employer firms — or companies that don’t have paid employees — that meant a large proportion of businesses were starting as new customers at these banks and were blocked from even pursuing PPP there. As a point of comparison, one in four white non-employer firms had set up a recent banking relationship. The New York Fed report emphasizes that this disparity in banking ties isn’t the result of Black-owned firms applying for financing at lower rates, but a product of their applications getting rejected by banks more frequently than those of white-owned firms in the past. According to a report from the Guardian, Black-owned businesses are twice as likely to be turned away for bank loans as white-owned businesses due to discriminatory practices. PPP, because it relied in some ways on businesses’ established banking relationships, amplified these gaps. “There is a structural flaw in this program. It uses banks as middlemen. Any time you create a big program and give banks the ability to choose which customers it prioritizes, you’re going to have disparities,” Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California Irvine, told NBC News. “Credit disparities are where past injustices lead to present disparities.” A study from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition that examined PPP loan applications captured specific examples of these biases. In some instances, it found that Black business owners with a comparable financial profile as white ones were less likely to be told that they met the qualifications needed for a loan. Small businesses that had established relationships with these banks didn’t necessarily fare better, either. A lawsuit from a group of California businesses alleges that Bank of America, US Bank, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo gave preferential treatment to companies that applied for larger loans — and approved them first — because it meant the banks would receive higher fees. In a CNN report, Bank of America and US Bank denied the allegations, while JPMorgan Chase denied the allegations on its website and Wells Fargo declined to comment. Parker notes that others in the entrepreneurial community had advised her to apply for the program through PayPal and said she had heard “horror stories” from other business owners about their experience with how banks handled these applications. Other business owners, including those whose applications were approved by banks, similarly encountered an arduous and complicated process. “The communication was so poor with the PPP, it alarmed me,” said chef Omar Mitchell, the owner of a Detroit fine-dining restaurant called Table No. 2. The different reactions to PPP in its first and second waves also highlight why some businesses may have opted out. When the first wave of $349 billion in funding was made available in April, that money ran out in less than two weeks. But after Congress approved another round of $310 billion, demand for the program appeared to slow. As of August 8, the deadline for applying for a loan, tens of billions still hadn’t been allocated. Fewer businesses may have either applied for or accepted the loan in the second wave because they had concerns about how the money could be spent. According to an SBA Inspector General report released in May, some of the initial PPP rules could have led businesses to take on more debt. PPP was first established, after all, with a specific goal: to help companies keep workers on the payroll even as their revenue took hits during the pandemic. That goal, while an important one, failed to account for the broader challenges that many small businesses faced during the pandemic. A significant proportion of the loans — 75 percent — for example, initially had to be used on payroll costs in order for the loans to be forgiven. If a business didn’t comply with the limitations, it would ultimately have to pay the loan back. (Congress has since loosened those restrictions so only 60 percent of the funds have to be dedicated to payroll, but the earlier rules deterred many small business owners.) “It didn’t suit what we were doing,” says Janet Webster Jones, the owner of Source Booksellers in Detroit. “I disliked the idea it was a grant until you didn’t spend it right.” In the end, a number of small businesses were worried that obtaining a loan would simply mean more debt if they weren’t able to meet the forgiveness requirements. “To take on more debt, it was very hard for them to say, ‘I’m going to take a chance on this,’” said Khalil Rahal, the assistant county executive in Wayne County’s Office of Economic Development. The restrictive design of the program, too, could have had an outsize impact on Black-owned businesses, which went into the recent economic crisis in weaker financial positions, on average, compared to white-owned businesses, according to the New York Fed report. Because of this dynamic, fewer Black-owned businesses may have pursued the loans due to concerns about qualifying for them and the worry of bringing on more debt. During the pandemic, Wayne County, as well as other regional organizations such as TechTown Detroit, also offered thousands of small businesses grants that didn’t have to be repaid, a move that helped many address some financial shortfalls. Outstanding questions about the utility of the PPP, coupled with the surge in local funds, may have led to more businesses in the region declining to participate in it. Business owners and experts emphasize that they sorely need another wave of PPP, but they argue that any new funds should explicitly be grants, not loans. “Just give people the money,” says Webster Jones. Currently, small-business owners have to apply for loan forgiveness after receiving PPP support — and they’ll only get 100 percent of it if they meet the program’s requirements. This means they must use a majority of the funds they’re given on payroll, for example. If the funds were a grant, they’d be much more accessible, especially as the challenges businesses are facing during the pandemic keep changing. For some businesses, many of their primary costs may be spent on operational needs, including personal protective equipment. “I think PPP ought not to be a loan at all,” Sheffield emphasized. “I can’t count how many businesses I know are closed.” Businesses also stress that funds should be set aside for companies that have seen explicit revenue losses, as well as those that are smaller businesses — which could be measured by size and revenue — to prevent larger ones from taking up a disproportionate amount of the aid. Prioritizing funding dedicated to Black-owned businesses, too, could help guarantee a more equitable distribution of support. “It hurts to go through what I’m going through,” says Mitchell.

8181,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/yale-discrimination.html,"Justice Dept. Sues Yale, Citing Illegal Race Discrimination","Advertisement Supported by The department says the school’s admissions practices violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yale’s president says the allegation was based on “inaccurate statistics and unfounded conclusions.” By Anemona Hartocollis The Justice Department sued Yale University on Thursday on the grounds that the prestigious university discriminated against white and Asian-American applicants during its rigorous admission process. A multiyear investigation, the Justice Department said, found that white and Asian-American applicants were one-eighth to one-fourth as likely to be admitted as African-American applicants with the same academic credentials. “Illegal race discrimination by colleges and universities must end,” Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband said in a news release about the lawsuit. He added: “All persons who apply for admission to colleges and universities should expect and know that they will be judged by their character, talents, and achievements and not the color of their skin. To do otherwise is to permit our institutions to foster stereotypes, bitterness, and division.” According to the Justice Department, the discriminatory practices constitute a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which says that programs receiving taxpayer funding cannot discriminate. Yale’s president, Peter Salovey, said in a statement on Thursday that the Justice Department’s allegation of racial discrimination was based on “inaccurate statistics and unfounded conclusions,” several of which the university tried to correct before the department filed suit. “I want to be clear: Yale does not discriminate against applicants of any race or ethnicity,” Mr. Salovey said. “Our admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale’s admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit.” Mr. Salovey acknowledged that the university did consider many aspects of a candidate’s life, including race and ethnicity, but only as one element in a thorough examination of academic achievement, extracurricular activities, military service and more. In August, the Justice Department accused Yale of violating federal civil rights law, in an escalation of the Trump administration’s moves against race-based admissions policies at elite universities. The department demanded that the university stop considering race or national origin in its next admissions cycle or face a federal lawsuit. The charge, coming after a two-year investigation of a complaint by a coalition of Asian-American organizations, was the administration’s second confrontation with an Ivy League school over admissions policies. Two years ago, the Justice Department publicly backed Asian-American students who accused Harvard in a lawsuit of systematically discriminating against them; a federal judge ruled in Harvard’s favor last year, but the federal government continues to support the plaintiffs. Like Harvard, Yale denied that its policies were discriminatory, saying its admissions process adheres to both federal law and Supreme Court rulings that have generally supported affirmative action. The Justice Department lacks the authority to force Yale to change its policies, requiring the lawsuit to attempt to enforce its ruling. A torrent of hate and violence against people of Asian descent around the United States began last spring, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Legal experts saw the department’s finding against Yale as an extension of conservative legal efforts to end race-based college admissions policies, a battle that is expected to eventually reach a Supreme Court that leans more conservative after two appointments by President Trump, with confirmation hearings for his third nominee set to begin next week. Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, called the Justice Department’s lawsuit “shocking and disheartening,” and said it contradicted decades of Supreme Court precedent that allowed for holistic admission processes. “Nothing less than the autonomy of our nation’s higher education institutions and their crucial role as engines of social and economic mobility is at stake,” Mr. Mitchell said. Several challenges to admissions practices, including at Harvard, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Texas at Austin, have been orchestrated by Students for Fair Admissions, a group that opposes affirmative action, and are making their way through the federal courts.

This is a blatant attempt to silence the PSL given their outspoken stance against the systematic racism in the United States; particularly in the wake of the violent murder of George Floyd and Elijah McClain. It is by no means an isolated incident. The United States has a long history of attempting to silence anyone who dares to defy them and vocally condemn the capitalist system which exploits workers worldwide.

It is no coincidence that the United States has now openly banned communists from seeking citizenships. We can be under no illusion McCarthyism is alive and well and it continues in its attempts to bully and silence those who seek to create a better world.

8368,https://www.thedailystar.net/editorial/news/delay-forming-cell-monitor-women-repression-cases-unacceptable-1985309,Delay in forming cell to monitor women repression cases unacceptable,"Despite a sharp rise in incidents of violence against women and children in recent years, we're alarmed by the consistent failure to comply with a High Court directive to form a cell to monitor progress in rape prosecutions and establish the accountability of court officials including judges, public prosecutors and investigation officers. Over three years ago, the HC had directed the registrar general of the Supreme Court to form this cell. If implemented, this would have played a vital role in ensuring that trials of cases under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 (WCRPA) are completed within 180 days. It would have also enabled the authorities to check possible negligence by court officials to finish trials on time and take appropriate action. Such flagrant disregard for an HC directive, by the Supreme Court administration no less, despite repeated appeals by anti-rape activists and civil society members, only validates the claim by the latter of deep-seated institutional apathy to prosecuting rape cases with the urgency that they deserve.  Part of the reason for the current culture of impunity emboldening rapists is the extremely low rape conviction rate in Bangladesh. According to section 20 of the WCRPA, the Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunals (there are 95 across the country) must finish the trials of cases filed under this law within 180 days of charge framing. Rape is one of the several offences that these tribunals try. Forming a monitoring cell will address only part of the problem, however, as victims often have to endure some combination of disrespect, negligence and prohibitive barriers throughout the justice-seeking process—starting from the initial reporting of a crime through to investigation and trial. This points to a larger socio-institutional problem for which wider reforms are needed. Experts have, therefore, called for a number of legal and institutional measures to empower victims to seek and get justice, including changing the definition of rape to include all victims, regardless of their gender identity or marital status, prohibiting the use of character evidence in rape trials, enacting a Victim and Witness Protection Act, and importantly, training police and court officials on dealing with sexual and gender-based violence, among other initiatives.  Having a monitoring cell to regularly check the progress of trials and ensure the accountability of relevant court officials can be a vital instrument, if not the only one, in ensuring justice for the victims. We urge the Supreme Court administration to step up to the plate and set an example for all justice sector actors so that they play the role necessary to uproot the culture of rape from our society. There can be no excuse for any delay in this regard, given how widespread and dangerous the culture of rape and other forms of violence against women has become.  আগামীকাল বুধবার থেকে লকডাউন শিথিল করার ঘোষণায় চালু হতে যাচ্ছে বাস, ট্রেন, লঞ্চ ও অন্যান্য যাতায়াত ব্যবস্থা।",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The woman, Gail Blair, was represented by First Liberty Institute, and William Wray Jr. of Adler Pollock & Sheehan P.C. The two firms reportedly took up her case because ""banning a blind woman from entering a public park simply because she offers people she meets religious material is outrageous and discriminatory,"" Jeremy Dys, special counsel for Litigation and Communications at First Liberty Institute, said in a statement. According to the charge of discrimination they filed, Blair stated in her own words that ""It has become clear that the Association has discriminated against me on the basis of my disability, my religion, and my religious message.” The charge of discrimination continues, ""In addition, the Association treats similarly-situated, sighted individuals and groups very differently. The park allows private and public events of all sorts, even those private events that are substantially more likely to result in littering than handing out pocket-sized copies of the Gospel of John by someone who is blind."" ""No government entity should ban anyone—let alone a gentle, blind woman—for simply carrying on conversations about her faith and giving them a copy of the Gospel of John in a public park,"" Jeremy Dys also stated concerning the case. Blair is happy with the ruling, saying in a statement to CBN News, ""I am thankful to First Liberty Institute and all my attorneys for fighting on my behalf and look forward to once again spending time in the park and sharing my faith in Jesus with those who are interested in having the conversation.""

8388,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/10/californians-should-vote-against-legalizing-race-discrimination/,California’s Proposition 16 -- Race Discrimination Should Not Be Legalized,"Follow Us National Review Governor Cuomo Resigns Why Did Some Stand by Andrew Cuomo? NSA Inspector General Investigating Tucker Carlson Spying Claims DOJ on Biden’s Lawless Eviction Moratorium: What Supreme Court Ruling? The Colorado Rockies Dinger Affair and the Racism Deficit In 1896, one man stood alone against the descent of Jim Crow over the South. John Marshall Harlan, in his famous dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, told the Supreme Court’s majority that, after the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments, there could be no such thing in American law as racial classifications: In respect of civil rights, common to all citizens, the Constitution of the United States does not . . . permit any public authority to know the race of those entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of such rights . . . There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color-blind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law . . . The law regards man as man and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved. Harlan was right, but it took more than half a century for the Court to begin returning to that original meaning in Brown v. Board of Education. In 1996, taking Harlan’s words to heart in an increasingly diverse state, over 54 percent of California’s voters passed Proposition 209, adding Section 31 to the Declaration of Rights in the state constitution: The State shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting . . . [other than] bona fide qualifications based on sex which are reasonably necessary to the normal operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. As then justice Janice Rogers Brown wrote for the California supreme court in 2000, Proposition 209 — the handiwork of University of California regent Ward Connerly — was intended to reverse two decades of the state’s “change in focus from protection of equal opportunity for all individuals to entitlement based on group representation,” and to prohibit any sort of racial or gender preference, quota, or set-aside. California leftists have chafed ever since at a color-blind constitution, nowhere more than in the state university system. The University of California system may be prohibited for now from making racial classifications, but that has not stopped it from hiring 175 “diversity” bureaucrats to promote racialized thinking, and requiring new faculty hires to submit “diversity statements” swearing allegiance to the ideology of racial group identity. Under cover of the George Floyd protests, California Democrats have placed on this year’s ballot Proposition 16, which would repeal Section 31. As the ballot initiative itself admits, it “permits government decision-making policies to consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin to address diversity.” Notice that this makes no pretense at using racial classifications to remedy discrimination or injustice. Instead, “diversity” would provide a permanent justification for a racial spoils system — putting California on an inevitable collision course with Harlan’s heirs in the federal courts. California voters should reject this path. The state’s multiracial, multiethnic population is far removed from simplistic black/white divides: The state estimates that its people are now 38.9 percent Hispanic, 36.6 percent non-Hispanic white, 15.4 percent Asian, 6 percent African American, and 2.2 percent “Multiracial non-Hispanic,” with the Hispanic and Asian populations rising, the white population sliding, and the black population holding steady. A population that diverse is likely to place different groups in a commanding political position in different localities. Allowing each group to entrench itself with legal discrimination in local contracting and schooling is a recipe for conflict among groups and injustice to individuals. It also requires an ever-more-complex system of racial classification against the tide of intermarriage and assimilation. A truly color-blind society may remain beyond our grasp, but the law should be a barrier to discrimination, not its enabler. That is all the more true in a state with such shifting, multi-polar demographics. The promise of California, and of 21st-century America, is that individuals can make their way in a society without a single, dominant majority group. The risk is that multiple racial factions will emphasize group identity as a way of each protecting their own. Moreover, the obvious target of Proposition 16 in higher education is to reduce the number of Asian Americans in the student body. Asian Americans currently make up 35 percent of students across the UC system, and higher among the most selective schools in the system — more than double their share of the state’s population. White admission rates, by contrast, have been declining steadily since the passage of Proposition 209. Targeting Asians is also the obvious motivation behind the state university’s drive to eliminate standardized testing. The irony for anyone branding this as a remedy for historic injustice should be obvious: California’s notorious history of anti-Asian discrimination dates back to the 1850s, when the state supreme court barred Chinese immigrants from testifying in court, describing them as a people “whose mendacity is proverbial.”  What is the need for discrimination in the name of diversity in the university system, if not to discriminate against Asian Americans? The 2020 class was the most diverse admitted in the UC system’s history, with Hispanic students outnumbering white students for the first time, and Berkeley admitting more African-American students than at any time since the 1980s. If anything, the recurring pattern of white academics pretending to belong to a non-white racial group suggests that the university system now operates on the opposite of “white privilege.” California voters should stand up on Election Day for a simple principle: Every Californian should be equal before the law.

Ten years ago, a spate of suicides prompted LGBTQ journalist Dan Savage and his partner, Terry Miller, to record a YouTube video promising queer teens that life would get better. Today, that mantra has been turned into an international movement and a nonprofit. That’s one of dozens of organizations working toward improving life for queer youth. Research shows that more young people – 20%, according to GLAAD – identify as queer than ever before. Despite all of that progress, a new study from the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank, and the research group NORC at the University of Chicago, reports that young queer adults face staggering rates of discrimination. “I was honestly shocked by the findings in the survey, just how widespread discrimination was,” said Sharita Gruberg, one of the study’s authors. The survey, conducted in June, captured responses from 1,528 self-identified LGBTQ adults 18 and older. Discrimination forced 54% of queer people to hide personal relationships, the report says. Fifty-five percent of transgender people reported avoiding public places for the same reason. More than 1 in 3 LGBTQ Americans (36%) said they were discriminated against over the past year, and 69% of nonbinary people reported facing discrimination in the same timeframe. Among transgender Americans, the rate was 3 out of 5. As stark as those numbers are, it’s the data among young adults that truly floored Gruberg: 67% of young adults surveyed in the study reported being discriminated against in the past year. The findings are a marked jump from a similar survey that the Center for American Progress conducted in 2017 that found one in four “LGBT” adults reported discrimination. Over half of those responding to this year’s survey said they were discriminated against in public while trying to use a bathroom, take public transit or go shopping, the report notes. “This is just people going about their daily lives,” Gruberg said. She is unsure why the numbers have increased so dramatically. Conducted at the height of the pandemic, the survey sheds light on troubling realities facing LGBTQ people as the virus ravages communities. Discrimination took a toll on the mental health of 52% of those surveyed. For Black LGBTQ people, that figure skyrocketed 77%. The findings, however, do align with other research on the community during the pandemic. A poll released by the LGBTQ suicide prevention organization The Trevor Project found depression skyrocketing among queer youth as many face isolation in unsupportive homes. “This year has been difficult for everyone, but it has been especially challenging for LGBTQ youth, and particularly Black LGBTQ youth, who have found themselves at the crossroads of multiple mounting tragedies,” said Amit Paley, CEO and executive director of The Trevor Project, in a statement. That Trevor Project poll reported that over 40% of LGBTQ youth said that the pandemic had hampered their ability to express their gender or sexual orientation; 55% of those surveyed said they had anxiety and 53% said they were suffering from depression. One glimmer of hope? “That is that the Affordable Care Act is working,” said Gruberg, adding that 88% of queer people said they had health insurance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8539,https://www.michiganradio.org/post/petition-drive-prohibit-lgbtq-discrimination-moves-forward-another-step,Petition drive to prohibit LGBTQ discrimination moves forward another step," The Fair and Equal Michigan campaign that seeks to amend Michigan's civil rights law to add anti-discrimination protection for LGBTQ people has submitted more than 483,000 petition signatures to state election officials, according to an announcement by the group on Tuesday. Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Act already prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, education, and public accomodations on the basis of a long list of characteristics that include race, sex, religion, age, national origin, family status, and weight. If election officials certify that about 340,000 of the submitted signatures are valid, the state Legislature has 40 days to decide whether to pass the citizen's bill. If the Legislature does not adopt the measure, it will be on the November 2022 ballot for the voters to decide. According to a survey of 600 registered voters conducted in June 2019 by the non-partisan Glengariff Group, roughly 77% said they would support a ballot proposal that would bypass the Legislature if it chose not to bar discrimination against LGBTQ people. Fair and Equal Michigan co-chair Trevor Thomas says the state Legislature has resisted enacting LGBTQ civil rights protections for decades. ""The LBGTQ community has been patient. We've done the hard work of changing hearts and minds,"" says Thomas. ""And it is time for the Legislature to catch up."" Thomas says discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is a harsh fact of life in Michigan and it needs to stop. ""We are asking to be treated like everybody else,"" Thomas says. ""A number of businesses, unions, the philanthropy community, non-profits support Fair and Equal Michigan in our effort to pass this legislation,"" says Thomas. ""Because it speaks to Michigan being a welcoming state, attracting the top talent. It's good for our economy. It's good for business. It's good for our communities, and it's also the right thing to do."" According to an April 2020 report by the Williams Institute of UCLA Law School, 23 states and Washington, D.C. provide non-discrimination protection on the basis of either or both sexual orientation and gender identity, although laws vary over what settings the protections apply to.  A petition campaign to add LGBTQ protections to Michigan’s civil rights law is deciding its next steps. That’s after a U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday that LGBTQ rights are already guaranteed by federal law.   A petition campaign will start gathering signatures to add protections for LGBTQ people to Michigan’s civil rights law.   The campaign to add LGBTQ rights to Michigan’s civil rights law has more time to collect signatures, but not in time to make the November 2020 ballot. That decision came Wednesday from a Michigan Court of Claims judge. She said restrictions on gatherings due to COVID-19 deprived the Fair and Equal Michigan campaign of the right to petition the government. But she also refused to reduce the required number of signatures.  The Fair and Equal Michigan campaign filed suit Tuesday in state court seeking an injunction that would reduce the number of signatures required and extend the deadline for the petition drive to amend the state's civil rights law. The group alleges it is impossible to collect the 340,042 signatures required by state law by May 27 due to coronavirus-related restrictions.

8579,https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20201021/ex-arlington-heights-cop-alleges-discrimination-based-on-his-assyrian-heritage,Ex-Arlington Heights cop alleges discrimination based on his Assyrian heritage,"A former Arlington Heights police officer alleges in a lawsuit filed this week he was discriminated against by fellow members of the department on the basis of race and national origin. Paul Valade | Staff Photographer, December 2018 A fired Arlington Heights police officer says in a lawsuit filed this week he was discriminated against because of his Assyrian and Iraqi heritage by colleagues, including the former police chief. Attorneys for Anfiny J. Eshoo, a patrol officer from May 2016 until his termination in January, said in a federal filing their client was subjected to repeated and continuous comments about his national origin and race throughout his employment, including being called and referred to as the ""Taliban,"" among other slurs. Upon being served with the lawsuit Wednesday, Village Manager Randy Recklaus said in a statement the village ""takes all such allegations very seriously, investigating them thoroughly, and taking all remedial measures deemed necessary."" And he wrote in an email, ""The village will defend this case vigorously."" The lawsuit alleges that during an Oct. 30, 2018, interaction with then Police Chief Gerald Mourning, the chief commented on Eshoo's beard and said, ""You look like a terrorist."" Other officers heard the comment, and Eshoo was commonly referred to as a terrorist by co-workers, his attorneys wrote. The next day, Eshoo said he found a photo of bearded terrorist suspects from the Sept. 11 bombings in his mailbox. He said he often found stickers, cartoons and other items reflecting slurs, according to the suit. The suit also states officers would play Muslim music on their computers around Eshoo. After Eshoo filed a human resources complaint in May 2019 alleging a hostile work environment and race discrimination, village HR Director Mary Rath wrote in a September 2019 memo that Mourning's comment was ""inappropriate,"" according to the suit. In light of that comment and the ""significant amount of inappropriate banter that takes place within the police department,"" Rath wrote, officials recommended anti-harassment training for supervisory and nonsupervisory department employees. But the suit states Rath told Eshoo there had been no adverse employment action taken against him or negative treatment as a result of his race, ethnicity or national origin, despite conduct by police that could be considered contrary to the village's anti-harassment policy. Eshoo's attorneys allege he was denied promotions because of his background. Recklaus noted Eshoo previously filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but it was dismissed in August after an investigator was unable to conclude there was any violation of applicable statutes. ""The village is committed to providing an inclusive working environment for all of our employees,"" Recklaus said in his email. The police department brought a complaint against Eshoo in April 2019 arising from a Feb. 22, 2019, call, alleging his failure to properly enforce an order of protection, the suit states. In July, he was placed on administrative leave amid an internal affairs probe in which he was accused of failing to properly conduct a preliminary investigation of a domestic battery, according to the suit. Eshoo alleges he was fired Jan. 6, for no legitimate reason and only after he had requested leave to care for his ailing father. Eshoo, of Palatine, is seeking a jury trial, wages and benefits he would have received but for the alleged discrimination, compensatory damages, and an injunction requiring the village to adopt employment practices and policies in accordance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything from the glow of your skin to the lack of it; your constant, incurable nausea; the shape of your growing stomach; the pattern of your sleep and the way you look, everything implies that it is a boy ‘this time’.  Your friends, neighbors, family members, all think that they are pleasing you by telling you that ‘this time’ you will be blessed with a boy.  Some of you may not believe it but I know this because this is exactly what happened with me last year, when I conceived for the second time at the age of 38 years, after years of denying any need of a second offspring. We took the plunge because our first born, my then 11 years old daughter, had been begging us to give her a sibling and we couldn’t say no to her anymore. So we decided to try granting her her wish and God listened to her as well.  And the new chapter began. Everyone was thrilled. The grandparents on both sides, uncles and aunts, our friends and neighbors, whosoever came to know was exhilarated to hear the news. More so, because it’s considered important to have two kids and it might be a boy child ‘this time’.  And the anticipation or rather manifestation of the male child began. “This time it will be a boy.” I heard this almost everyday and almost always replied that it could be a girl too.  I almost every time said that because one it was a logical thing to say as we couldn’t be sure of what it would be. Second, it didn’t matter to us and we were as thrilled to have anyone as our second born. Third, I didn’t want my unborn child if it was a girl to feel unwanted or not talked about. She was as much wanted as the he was.  I have never understood people’s, especially Indians’, obsession with a boy child. There are special rituals and celebrations related to the birth of a boy whereas a girl's birth sometimes isn't even considered worthy of congratulations. This is how things had been since generations and I had begun to think that things had improved but I was mistaken.  There is definitely some span now. A girl as a first born is celebrated because the childbirth is celebrated and she is a child and the hope remains that there will be a second time soon and with a different gender and so when the second time comes another girl is not expected, and definitely not verbally.  When it happened with me I was sickened by this biased anticipation. I am a well educated, modern, working, independent, proud woman and I was shocked to realize this brutal reality. Of course there were some exceptions who spoke neutrally but mostly it was the boy anthem I heard everywhere.  Personally I did not anticipate any specific gender because to me wanting one means not wanting the other. And that is so unfair. To the unwanted one.  And I didn’t anticipate anything in particular because I feel if is not what we wished for, then it is God-sent.  I just wanted a healthy child who would become our little companion for years to come and make our life’s journey more beautiful, abundant, adventurous, somewhat challenging and eventful.  And isn’t that the reason why we have children? To make our lives complete and hearts full with the love and care we feel for them and to evolve and become better persons as we are given the opportunity to become while bringing them up. And what does this beautiful life process have to do with a bias towards any gender?  We eclipse the light sent to our lives because of an age old belief that sons carry our names and legacy.  How wrong this obsolete belief is? Have you seen any name known in the history of this world because he or she was someone’s father, mother or grandparent?  People become famous and are remembered for their own deeds and contributions. They are known for their own accomplishments and attributes and not because of their successors’.  Our children are not the bearers of our negligible and insignificant names and legacies.  They are our gifts to humanity who come through us and because they come through us they get to be with us for many years. And for those years they become our companions and teachers.  Yes, I call my children my mentors. They have come to my life to teach me.  To teach me unconditional love and compassion in their initial years when I am required to just adore them and take care of them.  To teach me the value of my life, youth, good health and the way I live my life because that leaves impressions on their quality and perception of life.  To teach me patience and wisdom in their growing up years as without the two I can’t nurture their uniqueness and bring out the best in them.  To teach me all that I never learned as a child but have been given the opportunity again as their guide and companion.  To teach me humility as I have made and owned maximum mistakes as their mother and not in any other role and realized how fallible I am.  And one day they will teach me the value of my freedom and time for self when they will fly away from my nest to try their own wings.  Our children are our companions for many years in our own journey of life and its high time the society learned that the gender of our tiny companions is of no real concern in the world we live in today.  They are not for us to own, they are certainly not born to carry the burden of our unfulfilled desires and insignificant inheritances. They are here for their own journey and purpose and not to carry on with ours.  New life means a new journey and new life’s arrival is an event of celebration because it brings with it new hopes, dreams, another carrier of the virtues and legacy of humanity.  Yes. Legacy of humanity is the only legacy we need to pass on.  So whenever I prayed to God, which i did very often in those months I was carrying another life, I prayed to Him to bless us with a healthy baby and the wisdom and ability to bring him/her up to be a good and contributing human being.  And then His blessings came as a beautiful tiny bundle of joy who we named Rubayat which means God’s verse and lovingly call Sria which means joy. And it was a girl ‘this time’ too and we couldn’t be happier as our little girl brought into our lives much more happiness than we had dreamed of. Her protective father, her doting elder sister and her thoughtful mother, which is myself, have been on cloud nine since then. She is a dream come true and why not.  She has made our family complete and our hearts and house full to the brim with love, joy, beauty, cuteness, her smiles, her cries, everything that wasn’t there before she came along.  And another reason why she is a dream come true is because subconsciously I think I wanted to have her. I think I had always felt fascinated with the idea of becoming a mother of and bringing up two beautiful, bright, lively girls. Whenever I would come across such a family – mother, father and two daughters, I loved looking at them and would fantasize having a similar one myself.  To me all children are good, boys and girls, but it was a very personal emotion I never consciously thought about or even verbalized because I am not biased. I actually realized the feeling when my subconscious fantasy became a reality and filled me with an unparalleled joy. I would have been very happy to have a son too but having you, my most anticipated one and the God-sent, I became ecstatic.  Thank you God for being so kind and listening to the said as well as the unsaid and thank you my little girl for choosing me as your bearer, companion and guide for the years to come.  I will try to do my best. I promise!!! Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this post are the personal views of the author. They do not necessarily reflect the views of Momspresso.com.

8690,https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/the-pioneering-margaret-fairlie-scotlands-first-woman-professor-faced-huge-discrimination-in-a-male-dominated-field/,The pioneering Margaret Fairlie: Scotland's first woman professor faced huge discrimination in a male-dominated field - Evening Telegraph,"It’s 80 years since Margaret Fairlie became Scotland’s first woman professor after facing huge levels of discrimination. Gayle Ritchie explores the pioneering Angus-born medical scientist’s life and legacy. As job titles go, being Scotland’s very first woman professor is a fairly lofty one. Margaret Fairlie was a pioneer in her field – but she faced huge discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated field. Fairlie became the country’s first female professor – after a four-year battle – when she was given the Chair of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Dundee medical college of the University of St Andrews in 1940. She went on to inspire women across the globe to persevere and strive for the positions they deserve. Born in 1891, Fairlie grew up on a farm at West Balmirmer, between Carnoustie and Arbroath. She went to Arbirlot School before coming to Dundee to attend Harris Academy. From 1910 she studied at the Medical School in Dundee, then part of the University of St Andrews. She graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery in 1915, a time when it was “positively indecent to lecture to a woman in physiology and anatomy”, according to an unnamed professor. She then worked in Dundee as Professor of Midwifery and Gynaecology, and was known by her awed colleagues as “Madam”. During the First World War, Fairlie drove ambulances for the Scottish Women’s Hospital at Royaumont and undertook specialist training in obstetrics and gynaecology in Manchester. She returned to Dundee in 1919 and set up a consultant gynaecological practice, while also acting as honorary physician to Dundee Infant Hospital in Broughty Ferry. In 1925 she became an assistant at Dundee Royal Infirmary’s department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and began teaching clinical gynaecology in the Medical School in 1931, when she was also appointed assistant to the Professor of Midwifery. Five years later she became head of the department at DRI on the retirement of Professor John McGibbon. “That would normally have led automatically to her being appointed Professor in the Medical School in his place, but although staff at DRI and University College Dundee were willing, senior staff at the University of St Andrews were reluctant to appoint a woman,” explained Matthew Jarron, the University of Dundee’s curator of museum services. “It took four years to get them to agree, but her eventual appointment in 1940 marked the first time a woman was appointed professor in a Scottish university.” By receiving her rightful appointment, Fairlie made history and became Scotland’s first female professor. It’s worth noting that while Fairlie is often described as Scotland’s first female professor, technically she was only the first in a university,” said Matthew. “The Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music had appointed Emma Ritter-Bondy as Professor of Piano in 1892, but they were not a university and their professors presumably did not have the same academic standing. “University College in Dundee was renowned for its progressive approach, having been founded by a woman, Mary Ann Baxter, on the principal that all students, male or female, would have equal educational opportunities.” However, that view was not shared by many male staff. “One of Fairlie’s main colleagues in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology department, Alexander E Chisholm, wrote privately that the DRI directors, ‘have done a deed of perfidy’ by recommending her appointment as professor,” said Matthew. “At her induction, the principal of St Andrews, Sir James Irvine, boasted that this was a pioneering move for the university, though it is has been suggested that he was one of the main opponents of her appointment!” The significance of the appointment was not lost on the press. On June 12 1940, The Courier carried the headline: “Scotland’s First Woman Professor” and the story was widely reported across the UK. At the time of her retirement, in 1956, she remained the only female Scottish university professor.  It would be another two years before the University of Edinburgh would appoint its first woman to a chair and a further 22 years before Glasgow followed suit. Fairlie also acted as honorary gynaecologist to hospitals throughout Angus, ran an antenatal clinic in Nelson Street in Dundee and was actively involved in Dundee Women’s Hospital. She was also warden of West Park Hall of Residence for female students and was active in supporting the student medical society. A visit to the Marie Curie Foundation in Paris in the mid-1920s introduced her to the clinical applications of radium. She pioneered its use in Scotland to treat malignant gynaecological diseases. “Its considerable cost was often beyond DRI’s budget so she purchased radium from her own savings and is said to have stored it in a metal container in the meat store in her home on Windsor Street!” revealed Matthew. “When the Second World War broke out, all radium in the local area was collected up in case of invasion and buried in the Sidlaw Hills – it may still be there somewhere today! “Her radium work was particularly important to her – she later wrote: ‘One aspect of my work which has given me especial satisfaction and delight has been my continuity with the patients who attend the radium follow-up clinic… some of whom have been coming for 20 years. The atmosphere at this clinic is one of trust, gratitude and mutual affection.’” Fairlie also developed the forerunner of today’s vaginal smear tests for cancer diagnosis, punched-card record systems for maternity cases and was partly responsible for the beginnings of Dundee’s world-renowned teaching hospital. She became a Foundation Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1929 and was elevated to the Fellowship of the college in 1936. Fairlie never married but had many interests outside her work. She loved to travel and visited many European countries for holidays. She was engaged to her colleague at DRI, Dr Lloyd Turton Price, Professor of Surgery, but he died following a surgical operation in 1933, shortly before they were due to be married. As well as being a keen gardener and painter, Fairlie loved animals and owned a pet parrot. And one of her paintings is held by the Tayside Medical History Museum at Ninewells. “She was known universally to colleagues and students as ‘Madam’,” said Matthew. “One matron asked her: ‘Do you think if all the babies you delivered were laid top to tail they would reach from Dundee to Perth?’ Her reply was ‘Yes – and heading for Scone!’” It was while on holiday in Florence that Fairlie fell ill, returning home to pass away in 1963. Today, Fairlie is commemorated by two plaques – one in Discovery Walk at Slessor Gardens, and one as part of the Dundee Women’s Trail opposite the entrance to the former Dundee Royal Infirmary. The University of Dundee holds a regular Margaret Fairlie Lecture in her honour. But perhaps the greatest tribute was from one of her patients, who wrote: “She gave me the will to live”. Professor Sally Mapstone is Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of St Andrews, the second woman in succession to hold this role there. She said we must never forget what it took for women like Fairlie to achieve such success “against the grain”. “Margaret Fairlie was a trailblazer in medicine and in women’s education,” said Professor Mapstone. “The University of St Andrews is proud to be associated with the first woman to hold a Professorial Chair at a Scottish university, who was also a graduate of our university. “She demonstrated that women have every prerequisite to excel on a level with men when they are afforded the opportunities to do so. “Margaret’s life and work were transformational for her specialist subject of gynaecology, and indeed, for the Scottish academy more broadly. She demonstrated that women have every prerequisite to excel on a level with men when they are afforded the opportunities to do so.” “We must never forget what it took for women like Margaret to achieve such success against the grain; she remains inspirational in a world and a sector where there is still much more to be done for equality and diversity.” Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.

We salute their determination and courage in this massive protest demanding the withdrawal of the retrograde anti-Kisan agri laws. The Central Government was forced to relent and reverse its earlier decision of preventing our Kisans from reaching Delhi to peacefully voice their protest and allocated them a place to assemble. This ground, however, is too small for the tens of thousands that have reached Delhi. We the undersigned demand that a larger ground like Ram Lila Maidan or similar must be allotted for this peaceful protest and all necessary arrangements must be made for their stay and food. We reiterate our opposition to these new agri-laws that threaten India’s food security, abolish MSP, destroy Indian agriculture and our farmers- ‘Annadatas’.

9100,https://companyleader.themilitaryleader.com/2020/11/07/athena-thriving-gender-discrimination/,Athena Thriving: Combating Gender Discrimination in the U.S. Army,"A groundbreaking policy in 2016 opened every job, unit, and location in the Army to women. However, despite clear guidance from Army Senior Leadership, patterns of frustratingly pervasive sexism and gender discrimination remain within our ranks. A Government Accountability Office study earlier this year found that female soldiers, who make up 15% of the Army, are 28% more likely to leave service than their male counterparts. The similarly disproportionally high rates of sexual harassment and assault military women experience speak for themselves. The brutal murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillen earlier this spring at Fort Hood resulted in a flood of personal stories shared under the hashtag #IAmVanessaGuillen. This was a tipping point that reinforced the need for unit level leaders to drive significant cultural change for our Army to be more inclusive of women. It pushed us beyond ignoring longstanding problems of gender discrimination.   Placing “People First” means we must combat gender discrimination. This is the right thing to do. But, more importantly, it is fundamental to our nation’s ability to innovate and outpace our adversaries. Research shows that diversity in the workplace leads to a more talented and competitive workforce. Diversity increases organizational adaptability and enhances problem solving capability, factors that have the potential to increase our effectiveness and military prowess. If our goal is to develop an unparalleled military force, then it is imperative we enable leaders to build teams that tap into unlimited potential. This means eradicating gender discrimination and sexual harassment/assault. One word of caution: Many units still have no or very few women serving within their ranks. This reality can lull those leaders to place less emphasis on gender inclusion until more women arrive at their units. We beg you not to fall into that trap. Units cannot simply “flip a switch” on cultural change. If you don’t have women in your unit now, you will. You likely work with other units that already do. Set conditions now for successful integration. Sexism is the “prejudice or discrimination on the basis of sex or gender, especially against women.” Sexism exists within our units, both overtly and covertly, with malice and without (i.e.: unconscious bias). It is deeply rooted in conventions left over from a male-dominated profession born out of a male-dominated culture. It thrives in comments, gestures, “jokes,” harassment, and preferential treatment toward men. Sexism lurks in our team rooms, on the ramps of our combat vehicles, in our command posts, off-duty, and online. Sexism casts a shadow over a unit where women are not fully integrated and equal members of the team. It impairs the performance and growth of those soldiers and gives cover to the elements that actively harm them. Sexism breeds a culture that objectifies and devalues women. It sets the stage for discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, a hostile work environment, and retention issues among military women. To reap the benefits of a diverse and gender inclusive military force, we must address sexism. To this end, we review microaggressions toward sex, gender, and race in accordance with military standards. Microaggressions are prevalent vehicles for sexism. Sexist microaggressions are the commonplace verbal or behavioral indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, demeaning, or negative attitudes toward women. Some microaggressions are more subtle than others, but all of them speak volumes about who is, and isn’t, part of the team. For example… “I bet she didn’t have to meet the same standards that I did.” “She only got the job because she is a woman.” “Have you noticed she and 1SG spend a lot of time together?” (insinuating a sexual relationship) “You’re too pretty to be in the Army.” “The boys are out here getting after it.” (during a training event that includes women) A tank named after a prominent female porn star. “That’s what she said.” (in order to sexually charge an otherwise benign comment) “Take care of your men and equipment.” (as commander’s guidance) “Good morning/afternoon, gentlemen.” (in meetings where women are present) Sgt. Brittany Farley competes in the sprint, drag, carry at Camp Zama, Japan, June 9, 2020. (Winifred Brown) These are merely examples, but once you start to listen for such comments, you will likely find aggressive terminology all around us. These kinds of statements diminish the accomplishments of talented women, while not extending the same sentiments to their male counterparts. Furthermore, these microaggressions are alienating and insulting. Leaders must be on the lookout for sexism and make corrections to ensure soldiers understand that sexist innuendos have no place in our Army. Make these corrections immediately, publically, and professionally. Your actions during these moments will set the tone for your unit and give women on your team the confidence that you are serious about their inclusion. Some examples of corrective statements are included below. “Help me understand your thinking.” “I’m not comfortable with that.” “What I’m hearing you say is (harmful belief or stereotype). Is that what you’re saying?” “That’s not funny to me. Can you explain the joke?” “We don’t say things like that here.” (and avoid saying things like “we’re all thinking it but you shouldn’t say it out loud.”) “Would you care to repeat that?” “I don’t share that belief.” “That’s not okay with me.” “What you just said is harmful.” (and bonus if you can explain why) “I find that offensive.” These corrections should not be made in an effort to belittle or shame the offender. Ideally, they lead to productive discussions that shed light on the problematic nature of such comments. It also reinforces individual responsibility among us all in calling out sexist behavior, and is a clear demonstration of our adherence to the Army Values. Leaders uphold standards through on-the-spot corrections. A common abdication of this responsibility, and one that signals policies affecting women are not of concern to the command, is a reliance on women to police grooming standards on other women. There is no clearer sign that some service members are not on the team than a leader who can’t be bothered to read three pages of a common regulation on women’s appearance. That said, we are also mindful that Eurocentric hair standards can be damaging to women of color in the ranks. To achieve current standards for appearance, some women must use relaxers that can irritate or burn the scalp. Protective hairstyles such as braids, knots, twists, weaves, and wigs, while now authorized, are often targeted as “unprofessional” according to women we spoke with. Hair should not be a source of stress for a service member. It is often a source of identity, even confidence, for some women (and men). Leaders need to understand the struggles of textured and ethnic hair to reduce stress and prevent alienation among the ranks. Leaders with soldiers who struggle to maintain these standards should not assume they do so intentionally, and should instead engage in empathetic conversation to better understand why. Failing to understand and justly apply female and ethnic hair standards provides a vehicle for microagressions against women and black or non-white soldiers, discouraging them from feeling part of one cohesive Army team. Applying standards unevenly extends beyond appearance and grooming. Members of the group recalled leaders who refused to meet with women behind closed doors, or worse, refused to mentor them at all, to avoid the perception of impropriety. Yet these same leaders did so comfortably with other men. A workplace focused on accomplishing the mission should be more concerned with the content of a conversation than the angle of a door. Keeping women at arm’s length, with the assumption that other women will take the junior soldier/officer under their wing, fails in several respects. First, it assumes that other women, particularly with more experience and rank, will be available to mentor junior women. Despite the “leaders first” policy for gender integrating combat arms, the overall percentage of women in the Army is low — female mentors simply may not be available, particularly for low-density MOSs. Second, it reinforces the stereotypes that women are by nature nurturing and that their concerns are too radically different from men’s. While this article shows there are some considerations unique to women, it is insufficient to assume such knowledge will be passed down through an informal Army sisterhood. Finally, it is a failure of leadership. If you are unable to competently and comfortably mentor your women as well as your men, then you are not forging the strongest team possible. This group recommends the book Athena Rising, which addresses this topic in detail and inspired the title of this article. Cohabitation in field environments is often contentious and can create unintended sexism. For education and recommendations, we have included an article in the reading list titled “Committing to Gender Integration: Get Rid of the Female Tent,” which recommends units prioritize mission success over comfort, use informal leadership, and be comfortable asking “what’s best for the team?” However, keep in mind that, despite the practicality of these recommendations, you might have soldiers in your unit who remain uncomfortable with cohabitation. These concerns warrant consideration and merit candid and empathetic discussion with your teams to understand the origins of their anxiety so leaders can make informed decisions that balance mission requirements with the individual comfort level of soldiers. Compromises such as private changing areas and ground rules on clothing for all genders can alleviate these concerns. Units can also leverage the Army supply system to acquire individual pup tents, increasing unit field readiness and affording soldiers both privacy and comfort in gender-integrated environments. Lastly, an often overlooked topic is the issue of family care plans and how leaders may approach them with a conscious or unconscious bias against women who serve in either dual military or single family homes. Leaders should be wary of the stereotype of women as primary caretakers and ensure family care plans are discussed equally among men and women in their formations. In dual military families, for example, there are two service members responsible for the family care plan. It is prejudice and irresponsible to assume the caretaker role defaults to the woman just because of traditional gender roles. Furthermore, while women do make up the majority of heads of household for single parent families, men also make up a significant percentage—24% to be exact. Therefore, we recommend you make no assumptions when approaching your soldiers about their family care plans. A Soldier assists in the laborious and delicate art of rigging and packing a parachute. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Benjamin Vilchez) #1 on the CSA’s Sexual Harassment/Assault, Response And Prevention (SHARP) Top 10 List is that “Sexual assault and sexual harassment represents an insider threat with the potential to cause significant, irreparable harm to the Army.” According to DoD statistical data, 1 in 4 women report they’ve been sexually assaulted. Unfortunately, this problem is not going away on its own, despite clear focus from senior leaders. Between 2016 and 2019, rates of reported sexual harassment and sexual assault across the DoD grew for both active duty men and women. This group acknowledges an uptick in reports might correlate with the success of programs that have more soldiers reporting who were previously uncomfortable doing so; regardless, we’ve still got a lot of work to do in our formations. Sexual harassment and assault are a form of fratricide, plain and simple. They destroy teams, decay unit cohesion, erode trust, and inflict lifelong trauma on victims. According to the DoD Inspector General, our soldiers might be more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder from a sexual assault than any other type of traumatic event, including combat. When it does happen, we must take appropriate action under the circumstances while providing support to victims. We also must get beyond a reactionary culture and dig deeper into creating a climate of mutual trust and respect where harassment and assault will not happen. Actions speak louder than words, and your soldiers will watch with great interest when these incidents occur. Incidents of SH/SA are not naturally occurring phenomena that “happen” to victims. They are acts of violence most often perpetrated by one of the victim’s teammates. The FY19 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military concludes that more than 85% of victims knew their assailant, and alcohol was involved in 62% of the assaults. By and large, our soldiers are not being attacked by the Hollywood depiction of an unknown perpetrator jumping out of the bushes at night. They are being attacked by their brothers and sisters in arms. Units must train often on the prevention of sexual harassment and assault. Training must go beyond an annual handful of PowerPoint slides outlining reporting procedures and showing the “tea” video. Disseminating reporting procedures is certainly an important part of a comprehensive SHARP program, but we must do better. The Army has provided a plethora of SHARP training resources, readily available to all leaders. Training and education should make SHARP personal for your soldiers. It should provide a clear understanding that these are not things that happen “somewhere else.” Our soldiers should walk away from this training with a sense of anger and determination not to allow these things to happen to their teammates. Of note, this group does NOT recommend asking soldiers to share personal experiences of SH/SA. Instead, sanitized vignettes from previous SH/SA cases may be used as powerful tools to create dialogue and reinforce the humanization of male and female survivors. However, if you find that a survivor of harassment or assault is actively looking to share their story, it is crucial to support their ability to do so safely. We recommend you consult with your behavioral health team to ensure a safe and thoughtful avenue for disclosure. As leaders, we want to be careful to avoid retraumatizing the survivor. Sgt. Jasmine Jenkins, an M88 Recovery Vehicle commander, executes Table 4 mounted machine gun range, April 16, 2020. (U.S. Army photo by Gertrud Zach) Training should also avoid victim blaming. Additionally, discussions on “defensive” strategies for women (e.g.: don’t walk alone at night, don’t drink, don’t be too friendly, wear conservative clothing, etc.) might be more effective if you ask women to discuss their common defensive measures so men can better understand their perspectives. Among our roundtable, the men were astonished to hear stories of women in the group describe complex navigations of social situations that were seemingly innocuous to us, such as drinking at unit functions or having a meeting with a male superior alone. Ultimately, while the reality is that women must still implement defensive measures, we recommend the preponderance of training focus on why SH/SA is unacceptable, the impact it has on victims, and why we should not harass or assault each other. SH/SA training should focus extensively on consent and include the concept of “enthusiastic consent,” which is the idea that unless both intimate partners give an enthusiastic “yes,” then there is no true consent. Additionally, it is important to reinforce that consent can be withdrawn at any time for any reason by either party. This is a subject where sexist stereotypes and microaggressions drive distorted perceptions for young adults. Discussions can and should extend beyond preventing rape, assault, and harassment to encouraging healthy sexual relationships. Training should not center on repercussions for perpetrators. While it is true that SH/SA offenders can be subject to prosecution under UCMJ or the civilian justice system, that is tangential to the rationale for the training. The motivation should not be about avoiding jail time or other forms of punitive action; instead, it should be because in a team we treat each other with dignity and respect. If a leader is asked about false allegations, the leader should respond by educating the soldier on the process. All allegations will be investigated, and sometimes those allegations involve different versions of events from the alleged victim and the suspect. The military justice process is geared toward ensuring the accused maintains their Constitutional rights while determining whether the allegations meet the appropriate burden of proof. While each allegation of sexual assault will be investigated based on the facts and evidence presented, data from the Department of Defense indicates that a small percentage (1% in 2019) of accusations are determined to be false or baseless (compared to 63% where misconduct is substantiated) and, therefore, the fear of false allegations should not be the predominant concern for your soldiers if they do not harass or assault their teammates. It is clear that SHARP is rarely used as a tool to “get back at someone,” “get attention,” or “ruin someone’s career,” and instructors should focus the training to the task at hand: to eliminate sexual harassment and assault. Lastly, we should avoid “fear mongering” or trivializing SHARP. By this, we mean the idea that accidentally bumping into someone, promoting a female soldier (removing and replacing the rank), making a uniform correction, or other clear instances of appropriate physical contact will result in SHARP complaints. When you hear someone make a reference about how someone “got SHARP’d,” use that as another opportunity to delineate appropriate from clearly inappropriate touching. Commanders should be deeply involved in the development of the instruction, physically present, and involved during the training. Training should cover the fundamentals of SHARP for every soldier in your unit, but you should also consider advanced education commensurate to leadership positions. For example, a block of instruction that goes into detail on receiving reports and providing support to victims for company commanders and first sergeants. To promote candid and comfortable conversations, commanders should think outside the box for innovative training methods, such as meaningful group participation, external resources, and guest speakers. Lastly, don’t allow someone to rapidly flip through slides while a sign-in roster is passed around. Many of the leaders in our group have experienced such “training,” and allowing this to happen is just as damaging as allowing a microaggression to go unchecked. As with all training, you will set the tone with your level of preparation and involvement, as well as the standards you enforce. Commanders should plan and rehearse their Sexual Assault Response Plan with a heavy emphasis on support to victims. Response to a sexual assault is a battle drill that the staff and subordinate commanders must practice before it is put into action. Failure here is not an option. Our default should be that victims get whatever support they want or need within reason, and that they receive our deepest levels of empathy as they begin a long journey to recovery. Additionally, commanders must make a concerted effort to ensure victims (and alleged perpetrators) receive consistent updates on their case. Routinely follow up with them to ensure this is happening and engage the proper agency if it isn’t. Although survivors may respond variably to trauma, common, observable reactions to trauma include depressed mood, concentration issues, increased anxiety, being on edge/keyed up/overly alert, sleep problems/fatigue, hyper-sexual behavior, risk taking behavior, avoidance, increased alcohol use, illicit substance use, increased irritability, and isolation. While we, as non-healthcare providers, may not necessarily understand the linkage between these reactions and exposure to trauma, these symptoms are, in fact, well documented and based on decades of psychological research. It is important that we respond with empathy and use resources available to us and our formation, even if survivors seemingly do not match our expectation of “acting like a victim would.” If you observe these behaviors among soldiers who have experienced sexual assault, consult with your embedded behavioral health providers to formulate actionable plans that involve support and treatment. We also recommend that leaders be familiar with the legal process of making a report of sexual assault. Leaders should seek to answer the following questions: Who is allowed to know what (i.e.: confidentiality)? How do investigations work? What support is available to victims? What is the role of the special victim counsel? What can be done to alleged perpetrators while under investigation (e.g.: suspension of duties, relocation, protective orders, etc.)? What will we do if the accused is popular or high in rank? How will we prevent a backlash toward the victim or a “rallying” to support the accused while the investigation is ongoing? Some answers to these common questions can be found in the 2014 DoD Report on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, as well as the Army’s SHARP website. It is also crucial to highlight resources in the local area for soldiers in the event they feel uncomfortable using on-post resources or if they are away from their installation when an incident occurs. Consult with your embedded behavioral health providers who will be knowledgeable about off-post referrals and community-based resources. We encourage leaders to be proactive in implementing these suggestions and educating themselves about sexual harassment and assault. Doing so will likely minimize potential missteps that may be common when navigating such sensitive and challenging situations. In service of this goal, consider collaborations with JAG and your Behavioral Health Officer to develop leader professional development (LPD) seminars to educate junior officers and noncommissioned officers. Lastly, this group advocates that Commanders send their organic medical providers to the Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiner (SAMFE) course in San Antonio. This training can be invaluable in the aftermath of a sexual assault, particularly in a deployed environment. Although this article is focused on the unique issues faced by military women, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the occurrence of sexual harassment and sexual assault among military men. Per a VA report, 1 in 100 male veterans have experienced Military Sexual Trauma (MST). Although the rate of sexual harassment and sexual assault is higher among military women, there are significantly more men who are victims of sexual harassment or assault but never report. The lack of discourse and emphasis on male survivors of sexual trauma underscores sexist beliefs that men, or more harmfully put, “real men,” do not experience sexual harassment or assault. These are damaging messages rooted in a culture of sexism that not only disenfranchises women but also disempowers men to speak up when they have been victimized. An often overlooked idea is that sexism in our organization impacts us all, women AND men in uniform. Army Spc. Catherine Downes moves through an obstacle during the 2020 U.S. Army Reserve Best Warrior Competition at Fort McCoy, Wis., Sept. 5, 2020. (U.S. Army Reserve photo by Staff Sgt. Kenneth D Burkhart) Beyond creating a climate within units that eliminates sexism, sexual harassment, and sexual assault, there are several unique aspects to leading gender integrated units that remain taboo topics among some leaders in the Army. An important aspect of inclusion is to bring these issues to light and educate leaders so they aren’t relegated to hushed whispers between women who rely on generational knowledge passed down from generations to aid one another in survival. If you’re a leader in our Army, you should be familiar with the following women’s health topics so you can provide or enable the level of care and readiness that all of our soldiers deserve. Statistics show that men and women are treated differently in healthcare settings. For instance, women wait longer to be treated for similar abdominal pain levels than men. The most at risk population for inequities in adequate pain mitigation is African American women. Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women – and this disparity increases with age, according to research from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report in the MMWR. Soldiers’ pain should be acknowledged, and if a soldier is unsatisfied or confused with the care of providers, leaders must act by encouraging her or him to continue to work with the provider. If the soldier is still unsatisfied, resources are available, such as patient advocates and the Interactive Customer Evaluation (ICE) process. Give all soldiers the information they need to take charge of their health and the resources to identify the care they need. Field conditions present different considerations for women than men. With a proactive approach by leaders, women can be well prepared to remain healthy, avoid inconveniences, and be tactically effective. FM 21-10 (Field Hygiene & Sanitation) recommends all soldiers bathe as often as possible and daily for menstruating soldiers. However, this does not mean women must be evacuated to shower facilities, particularly when their male peers are not. Field expedient measures can be sufficient, but leaders must plan when and how they will afford all soldiers the resources and reasonable privacy to accomplish personal hygiene while in the field. There are great commercial options available for portable latrines and shower tents that provide sufficient privacy but do not take up space or require much time to establish. Vaginitis and Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are two common conditions women can experience while in field conditions, but education, hygiene, and precautions can reduce the risk of infections. Check to confirm your medics, field sanitation team, and leaders are educated on ways to prevent these conditions and that all leaders (men and women) and healthcare professionals (i.e.: PAs, medics, etc.) are educating women on preventative measures. In addition to urinary and vagina infections, women (and men) commonly experience fungal skin infections during field training. Hot and humid weather, excessive sweating, wet conditions, decreased hygiene, restrictive clothing, and pregnancy increase risk for developing a fungal infection. Typical locations include the breast folds, groin, and inner thighs. The preventative measures for fungal infections are good hygiene (frequent cleaning), changing socks and underwear frequently, staying dry, and applying powder to problem areas. Packing lists for women should include sufficient supplies of feminine hygiene products, but leaders should ensure unit medics maintain backup supplies of a variety of these products. These items are easily available in the Class VIII supply system and NSNs exist for ordering. Unexpected menstruation, or heavier than anticipated menstruation, should not cause undue stress if soldiers and leaders are prepared. As a leader YOU are responsible for the complete sustainment plan of your unit. This includes ensuring there are plans to properly dispose of all waste, including used feminine hygiene products. Soldiers should never be forced to carry these used items with them in Zip-Loc bags in their cargo pockets, as was the case for one of our participants. A U.S. Military Academy cadet participates in an obstacle course during training at West Point, N.Y., July 20, 2020. (U.S. Army photo by Matthew Moeller) Leaders should also plan to provide time and space for urination. Women who cannot urinate frequently or during restrictive operations will often limit their fluid intake, leading to dehydration and increasing their risk for other medical problems such as UTIs, heat injuries, kidney stones, and seizures. To assist women with urination, there are several optional Female Urinary Devices (FUD) available in the supply system. FUDs require some preparation and training to use (one source recommends practicing in the shower before going to the field), but the FUD can help women urinate through the fly of the uniform while standing and without having to remove gear. This skill and capability is particularly important for women restricted to the inside of combat vehicles during operations or in areas of high threat, such as IEDs, where dismounting is infeasible. Contraceptives have a wide range of benefits beyond preventing pregnancy, including reducing risk of reproductive cancers and regulating menstrual disorders. Access to contraception is also mandated by law. Indeed, Section 718 of the 2016 NDAA required the DoD to ensure “women members of the Armed Forces have access to comprehensive counseling on the full range of methods of contraception.” As such, leaders must educate themselves on various forms of contraceptives available to women. These include pills, implants, injections, vaginal rings, surgical procedures, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). To start, leaders can read about birth control basics here. Do not assume your soldiers understand the range of options available to them. Young women, especially those who did not have access to comprehensive sex education, might not know about the variety of available contraceptives or how to access them. To address this, we recommend you engage your unit medical provider to coordinate educational opportunities for your soldiers (e.g.: women’s health expo). You and your soldiers can also obtain contraceptive information and resources from your installation Women’s Wellness Clinic. This service received rave reviews among the women in our group. Lastly, we recommend you ensure leaders in your formation are equally knowledgeable about contraception. Conduct a leader’s recon to engage the staff on what services are available to your soldiers and request education for your leaders. While healthcare providers strive to provide the best medical care to their patients, a 2019 Congressional Research Service study identified the lack of standardization for training on contraceptive methods among DoD healthcare providers as a potential issue. This specific issue could impact how female soldiers are counseled on the contraceptives available to them, particularly when needing to account for upcoming extended field exercises or deployments. We have no reason to suspect widespread negligence among Army healthcare providers, so we recommend engaging your unit providers to ensure soldiers are getting access to the contraceptives that best fit their needs. In other words, “trust but verify.” Lastly, advocate for your medics and unit providers to have time away from the Troop Medical Clinic for skills sustainment training, including OB/GYN and other specialty fields. Leaders should also understand and educate soldiers on the availability of emergency contraception. “Plan B” is available in military health facilities without a prescription. Abortions, however, are not performed in military medical facilities, nor are they covered under Tricare, unless the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest, or the life of the mother is at risk. While abortion remains a controversial topic in the United States, and despite your personal beliefs, Army leaders should be aware that soldiers may choose to, and have the right to, terminate an unwanted pregnancy. With this in mind, it is worth educating both leaders and soldiers where safe facilities exist, understanding they could be located far away based on the availability of clinics. Depending on circumstances and location, government transportation may be authorized for transporting service members to gain access to an abortion. Women might not be inclined to discuss an abortion with their chain of command, but you should ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 a mileage pass, financial support, or a physical profile. Soldiers might not be comfortable with discussing why. With this in mind, we cannot overemphasize how important it is to develop trusting relationships with our soldiers. Women in the Army face difficult decisions when choosing if and when to have children. The consensus of this group is that there is no magic solution or “perfect time” for women to become pregnant, give birth, and recover. However, across the board, the women within our roundtable were adamant that the empathetic support of leadership in the chain of command was the single greatest enabler to family planning, reduced stress, and a healthy pregnancy when it came to career-related issues. Leaders should avoid any assumption that all women want to, or are able to, become pregnant. Avoid asking questions such as, “When do you plan on having kids?” To be clear, these kinds of questions can be just as offensive to male service members afflicted with infertility issues. Rather, as with any soldier, we recommend you shape these discussions around the full spectrum of personal and professional goals. For example, you may choose to ask, “What are your short- and long-term family goals, and how can I support you?” This is perhaps the single greatest conversation driver a leader can ask. If a woman decides to discuss pregnancy as part of her goals, the leader should help the soldier develop a comprehensive plan that considers deployments, operational requirements, fertility challenges, options for limited duty, maternity leave, and postpartum recovery. This advice applies to men as well. Part of “People First” is showing soldiers that we care about their families, which includes letting them go to appointments and ensuring they can provide support to their spouse before, during, and after pregnancy. Fertility is a critical aspect of family planning. With early career pressures, some soldiers might feel compelled to prolong family planning, increasing the risk of fertility issues. Additional risk factors associated with higher rates of infertility among military include exposure to toxins, use of psychiatric medication, and higher rates of sexual trauma. Although military women of various demographic backgrounds may experience fertility issues, infertility rates are highest among women in their 30s, senior enlisted/officers, married women, and non-Hispanic black women. Fortunately, fertility programs exist for service members, retirees, and dependents at the following installations: Walter Reed (WRNMMC), Tripler (TAMC), Womack (WAMC), Madigan (MAMC), Joint Base San Antonio (SAMMC), and Naval San Diego (NMCSD). Although the Military Healthcare System has adopted these services, several access to care issues exist. For starters, fertility services are not covered by TRICARE, placing an undue financial burden on those seeking fertility treatments. As leaders, we may not be able to solve organizational challenges to improve access to care; but, we can provide empathy and support to our soldiers struggling with infertility. It is important that we are aware of medical issues that disproportionately impact women in uniform. First and foremost, pregnant soldiers are not broken soldiers. You shouldn’t wrap them in bubble wrap and separate them from the rest of the unit. You also shouldn’t be upset because their pregnancy puts them in a non-deployable status or they miss the NTC rotation. Leaders must be deliberate in maintaining their inclusivity on the team by assigning them meaningful work that is within their capabilities. Put another way, a pregnancy is a limited time frame in a woman’s career when she is “on profile.” You should afford pregnant soldiers the same respect and latitude you provide to soldiers with any kind of profile. A lengthy profile that precludes someone from deploying doesn’t create a negative environment unless a leader encourages or condones it. While every pregnancy is an intensely individualized experience, pregnant soldiers want to continue contributing to the team in a fulfilling way. Enabling this might require you to change the environment in which they work or the duties they perform, but you should not separate pregnant soldiers from their units. By including pregnant soldiers in planning and operations, you ensure they can more seamlessly reintegrate into their duty positions when they are postpartum. While this group had plenty of great discussion on the topic of pregnancy, in the scope of this article we will not attempt to recreate the depth of material available in the Army’s 2010 “Guide to Female Soldier Readiness.” While ten years old, it contains a wealth of information on environmental considerations for conception, pregnancy counseling, profiles, postpartum considerations, and many more. We highly recommend this document as a starting point for all leaders. However, some specific recommendations from this group are below. Detailed pregnancy counseling should be done with every soldier, regardless of rank. This counseling should create shared understanding and open dialogue. Leaders must know their soldiers’ rights throughout pregnancy and postpartum. These discussions must also include honest dialogue about family care plans and options for administrative separation from the Army, should the soldier choose. The guide referenced above provides topics, outlines, and examples of effective pregnancy counseling. 2nd Lt. Nicole M. Leighty establishes communication at the beginning of Cerberus Stakes, a 36-hour, nonstop training exercise executed by Cerberus Battery, 5th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery Regiment. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Amanda Hunt) Pregnancy and Postpartum Physical Training (P3T) is a tremendously beneficial program when executed to standard, and it is not optional. Leaders should familiarize themselves with the P3T programs at their installation. One key consideration is whether the P3T program is centralized or conducted at the brigade or battalion level (each has its advantages and disadvantages). Regardless, P3T programs must be run by individuals who have been properly trained and understand the long-lasting impacts of improper training while pregnant, not as an additional duty or tasking. Lastly, as a commander, you likely do PT with your platoons, but how often do you go do PT with the P3T program? This simple gesture demonstrates your support to all of your soldiers and allows you to spot check the effectiveness of the program. Additionally, leaders should be aware that pregnant and postpartum soldiers may desire additional medical care that will require more time for appointments and for recovery. For example, soldiers may want to receive a referral to a pelvic floor physical therapy exam between 6-8 weeks postpartum to help alleviate future injuries and help guide soldiers as they begin safely training for the ACFT. This might be a scarce resource and not available on every installation, and it may require soldiers to attend frequent appointments off-post. However, the long term impacts on soldier well-being and ability to continue their physical fitness regimens post-pregnancy may rely on it. Sadly, early loss of pregnancy (miscarriage) happens in up to 31% of pregnancies. While Army Regulation provides clear guidance for women who miscarry beyond 20 weeks, prior to 20 weeks is more heavily dependent on the empathy and decisions of the Chain of Command. With any miscarriage, there is likely tremendous grief that needs to be acknowledged along with physical, mental, and spiritual recovery for both partners in the relationship (if applicable). Commanders should provide extensive support and convalescent leave, if required, to allow for proper recovery after a miscarriage. Lastly, ensure you are engaging your profile providers to understand how they approach recovery for miscarrying soldiers. It is critically important that Army leaders support breastfeeding soldiers, and that this support begins when the soldier is pregnant. The American Academy of Pediatrics advocates breastfeeding for the first 12 months of life and the World Health Organization recommends for the first 24 months. Breastfeeding may not be a short-lived experience for some mothers, so we must make it convenient for them. Not only is this the absolute right thing to do for the health of child and mother, it has been Army policy since 2015 with Army Directives 2015-37 and 43, and has been incorporated into the recent publication of AR 600-20. Commanders are required to designate private and proper space, time, and provisions to express milk during field training, mobility exercises, and deployment (to maintain physiological capability for lactation). There are a variety of readily available resources to assist Army leaders in upholding these requirements and providing maximum support to breastfeeding mothers in your formation. When in doubt, contact a certified lactation consultant to assist you in establishing spaces or procedures to support breastfeeding mothers in your organization. AR 600-20 articulates a number of requirements to support breastfeeding soldiers. In addition to those, here are some tips for leaders establishing lactation rooms in their organizations: Ensure that leaders (and this may include you) are having candid discussions with postpartum soldiers who are going to the field. Postpartum soldiers may be concerned with maintaining their milk supplies and preventing infections. Uncertainty around pumping can lead to anxiety; therefore, leaders need to have safe field breast-pumping procedures that reduce the risk of medical complications associated with infrequent breast-pumping, such as mastitis. Mastitis occurs in up to 10% of breastfeeding women and is associated with oversupply of milk, infrequent feedings, and maternal stress/fatigue. While most common in the first 12 weeks postpartum, it can occur anytime while breastfeeding. In addition to breast pumping procedures for the field, leaders will also need to develop a feasible logistics plan to transport breastmilk to a caregiver in the rear. This will require some planning and preparation, but one option would be to place breast milk in a cooler, take the cooler to a refrigeration unit at the field kitchen, transport it to the rear with LOGPAC, and then hand it off to the caregiver. If stored at refrigerated temperatures, breast milk can last up to 72 hours, which is a reasonable window for transportation. Above all else, postpartum soldiers must know they are supported. A supportive command team will alleviate a good portion of that stress and anxiety, helping soldiers perform their tasks so they can focus on their training while in the field. Lastly, this group investigated whether shipping breastmilk home while TDY is an authorized expense in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation. Our assessment is that it can be authorized by a Defense Travel Systems (DTS) Approving Official (AO), and we spoke to women who have successfully done this. Interestingly, the words “breast,” “breastfeeding,” or “breast milk” are not specifically mentioned anywhere in the JTR, which this group recommends as an update to remove ambiguity. One word of caution, however, is that the overnight shipment of breastmilk could cost hundreds of dollars and not be fiscally reasonable given unit travel budgets. Units should forecast accordingly.

(U.S. Army photo by Paolo Bovo) The team who wrote this article sincerely hopes it assists unit level leaders in the continued integration of women in our Army. We believe very strongly that, aside from passionate leaders driving cultural change, teaching our leaders about the subjects above and empowering them with resources they need will have the most significant impact in this endeavor. This group encourages leaders to discuss the issues in this article, and our hope is this article provides a framework to lead those conversations. One idea is to form an informal “Soldier 2025 Forum” in your unit, where you talk about what your team wants the Army of the future to reflect in diversity and inclusion, and how you can take action at your level. This forum could be used to discuss ideas in this article on gender discrimination, along with other topics on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. on a monthly rotation. Through candid and engaged discussions such as this, leaders can help create the most integrated winning force our Army has ever seen. Army senior leaders have been crystal clear in this effort. In 2016, Under Secretary of the Army Patrick J. Murphy proclaimed, “We’re not going to turn our back on 50 percent of the population.” Support from senior leaders is absolutely necessary, but now the lion’s share of the work rests with leaders at the company and battalion levels. But to be clear, none of the topics covered in this article are new experiences or solitary incidents. These are topics we, as a culture, have historically designated as “women’s problems” and slapped with a “taboo” label. Many service members have put up with patterns of being ostracized, many have spoken up, and far more have found themselves in command climates where they have not been able to share their concerns or experiences. By opening up this conversation and echoing the voices of women who have felt every shade of sexism, we are sowing the seeds for more empathetic leaders in the future. For the older leaders, the Army we joined many years ago is not the same one we are now called to lead. We must adapt. Commanders must do their duty and crush the organizational and systemic obstacles facing women in their units so they can thrive to their fullest potential. Doing so will increase good order and discipline, improve retention of women in the Army, and enhance combat effectiveness. We are the greatest Army in the world, and that means we understand the entire world is watching. Young women who could enhance our military are hearing stories like these and watching with bated breath for our next move. Some may be deterred, but many are not. The next generation of Athenas are waiting in the wings. Some soldiers may be tempted to fight this movement, but their time in the Army will eventually come to an end…sooner than later without behavioral changes. “People First” does not condone privileging soldiers and prejudicing others because of their gender, race, or religion. To those resistors, we implore you to educate yourselves and search inside your hearts and minds for factual truth: women are fully capable of meeting and exceeding the standards for service in all aspects of our Army. This truth has been proven by data, science, precedent, and the sheer grit of women who refuse to allow deep-rooted misogyny to stand in their way. Supporting women with the recommendations in this article is a necessary investment that will reap infinite returns. To our sisters in arms: we hear you, we see you, and we support you. There are many more of us who wish to see you thrive than there are those who could ever have a hand in your downfall. Your allies will not stop fighting for you. Inch by inch, we will continue making this profession safe for you and all those who wish to follow. The changes we make here, the parts of our culture we address now, and the support we give down the line will only increase our Army’s effectiveness as a fighting force.

We've received your submission. Metro By Rebecca Rosenberg Submit November 10, 2020 | 1:03pm A former top NYPD chief who said she was ousted from the department for being older, white and female has settled her lawsuit against the city for $330,000, according to court records and a Law Department spokesman. Diana Pizzuti, the NYPD’s first female chief of personnel, was 61 when she filed the Manhattan federal lawsuit in July 2019 against the city, former Police Commissioner James O’Neill and First Deputy Police Commissioner Benjamin Tucker. Her lawyers argued that she was unceremoniously booted from her position in January 2018 and was replaced with a white Irish man. “We don’t have a spot for you,” Tucker allegedly told her when she objected to being pushed out. Her attorney John Moscow had argued that O’Neill wanted a “younger and more diverse” NYPD. By creating vacancies in the ranks of chief, they could transfer their favorite candidates to these slots and make more diverse promotions in the new openings, the suit alleged. Joanne Jaffe, the department’s first female three-star Housing Bureau chief, who was forced out at the same time as Pizzuti, made similar discrimination claims in a separate lawsuit. She is also represented by Moscow and her suit is still pending. The NYPD didn’t immediately return a request for comment. Read Next NYC's latest COVID-19 figures are 'a warning sign': de Bla...

9209,https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-hartford-housing-lawsuit-20201118-7wgz7kjy3rbkhcn7fvnxkrkuvu-story.html,"Federal lawsuit accuses HUD Secretary Ben Carson, the City of Hartford and local housing authorities of housing discrimination","Residents of subsidized housing in Hartford sued the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development Wednesday for violating the Fair Housing Act when it failed to move families to less racially concentrated communities outside of the city. “Although HUD has a duty to counteract segregation in Hartford, it has instead perpetuated segregation there,” the suit alleges. “Rather than making subsidized housing available to low-income families in places like Farmington or Glastonbury, HUD has disproportionately placed developments in North Hartford and other racially concentrated areas.” The lawsuit comes two years after residents of a subsidized housing complex in Hartford won a prolonged battle against a notorious New York City landlord and HUD was required to assist residents and move them to new homes. But the new complaint alleges that HUD failed to develop a plan “that would have helped those families move to less racially concentrated, higher-opportunity areas outside of Hartford.” Instead, the suit alleges that HUD and other housing authorities relocated tenants quickly and without mobility counseling services that could help them to move to higher-opportunity areas. As a result, the vast majority of families “stayed in Hartford or moved to other low-opportunity areas.” The Center for Leadership and Justice, a nonprofit organization located in Hartford, filed the class action complaint to the U.S. District Court in conjunction with eight individual plaintiffs who lived in three North Hartford developments at the heart of the lawsuit: Clay Arsenal Renaissance Apartments, Barbour Gardens Apartments and Infill I. The defendants also include HUD Secretary Ben Carson, the Housing Authority of the City of Hartford and Imagineers, LLC, a Connecticut-based housing services company. “This is not a lawsuit that aims to move people out of Hartford to the suburbs,” said Rev. AJ Johnson, organizer for the Center for Leadership and Justice. “It’s not a lawsuit that encourages people of color to move to racist communities. It’s not a lawsuit that gives up on this city that we love and that I love. It’s a lawsuit, plain and simple, that says people who are low income, people who are Black and brown deserve choice and options, all protected under fair housing law.” The three North Hartford properties named in the complaint have been the focus of lawsuits and HUD attention for years. In 2018, after years of neglect, HUD terminated its million-dollar-a-year contract with Clay Arsenal Renaissance Apartments owner Emmanuel Ku, stating that the 26 apartments were said to pose “major threats to health and safety"" and vowing also to move approximately 250 tenants into new properties. “I want you to imagine staying up all night in your infant’s room so you could stomp your feet on the floor as rats approached the bathroom,” Cori Mackey, executive director of the Center for Leadership and Justice, said at a press conference Wednesday. “Thousands of residents in this city don’t have to imagine these conditions because they live and are living this nightmare,” Mackey said. “They’ve lived this nightmare while HUD turned a blind eye, giving lucrative contracts to slumlords who pocketed millions and traumatized so many families and children.” HUD later canceled subsidy contracts with Barbour Gardens, an 84-unit development, and Infill I, which consists of 52 separate units in the North End. Howard Rifkin, corporation counsel for the City of Hartford, responded to the lawsuit on behalf of Bronin in a statement. “We have to admit that we’re puzzled by the fact that the city is named in this lawsuit, since the city worked hand in hand with the Center for Leadership and Justice at every stage of the process to get rid of these slumlord owners and to relocate residents both in and outside of Hartford,” Rifkin said. “In January of this year, Senators Blumenthal and Murphy, Congressman Larson, and Mayor Bronin sent a letter to HUD Secretary Carson asking that he take immediate action to address underlying, systemic issues that HUD failed to address at several housing projects in the North End of Hartford.” Ashley Matos, 29, a named plaintiff, lived in Infill for 11 years, where she experienced mice infestations, constant water leaks, electrical issues and what she said was an “assassination-style murder” across the street. She was unable to find housing outside of Hartford. “I dreamed of moving out of Hartford, along with my kids, into a clean apartment where my infant could crawl all over the floor and we wouldn’t have to worry about mold or [electrical] circuits turning up on fire,"" Matos said. ""But that just turned into a dream.” Matos felt hopeful upon receiving her voucher from the Hartford Housing Authority nearly two years ago. Though she was out of work and had credit problems, Matos thought the voucher would help her land an apartment in West Hartford, Windsor Locks, Enfield, Windsor or Bloomfield. Attorneys for the plaintiffs include Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization, Open Communities Alliance, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and Covington & Burling LLP. Erin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, said she hopes the lawsuit will grant a redo to the North End families who were displaced. “They were living in an unacceptable housing conditions and units that were funded by the government and they were forced to relocate,” said Boggs, “and we would really like to see a do-over because they didn’t have their fair housing rights vindicated during that relocation process.” Michael Hamad can be reached at mhamad@courant.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9301,https://www.krem.com/article/news/local/former-srhd-employee-suing-amelia-clark-for-discrimination-retaliation/293-db971677-ecb5-4a4c-a598-8ca18bc2aed1,"Former employee suing Amelia Clark, SRHD for discrimination and retaliation","SPOKANE, Wash — The controversy surrounding the firing of Spokane County Health Officer Dr. Bob Lutz has uncovered other possible issues within the Spokane Regional Health District. Lutz said he was fired by SRHD Administrative Officer Amelia Clark on Thursday and he has been denied access to the health district building. He said he was also offered a severance package, which he’s refused. Lutz said he plans to pursue all “available legal remedies” if the Spokane Board of Health votes to terminate his position. Lutz isn’t the only former employee who’s contacted a lawyer about termination of their employment. The Health District’s former Division Director of Health Promotion Kyle Unland filed a lawsuit on July 2, 2020, according to court documents. He claims he was fired after he raised concerns with human resources about being discriminated against because of his gender and race, as a white man, the lawsuit says. Unland spoke with KREM 2's Amanda Roley about the lawsuit and what is happening to Lutz. ""I was really, really troubled to see what happened to him,"" he said. ""You know as something that happened to me when I saw it, it's like, 'Wow that looks really familiar.'"" The lawsuit says Unland held his position since June 2010 where he oversaw more than 15 programs designed to reduce chronic diseases, managed a multi-million dollar budget, supervised more than 50 employees, and oversaw and wrote grants and funding proposals. Unland was previously employed at the Washington State Department of Health Section Manager for nine years for the Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity Prevention Department, according to the suit. Overall, the lawsuit says Unland has 26 years of experience in public health. According to the lawsuit, Unland submitted his application to a recruiting agency contracted by SRHD to recruit, select, interview and participate in the hiring decision to fill the vacant SRHD Administrative Officer position in May 2019. Unland was among seven applicants selected for interviews with the SRHD Board of Health selection committee, according to lawsuit. On June 27, 2019, Unland attended a SRHD Board of Health meeting and learned the top four candidates for the position had been invited to in-person interviews with the committee while he was out of town on SRHD business, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit claims Unland was not selected for the final interviews because he is a white man. The suit also claims Unland was the best qualified candidate to fill the position. According to the lawsuit, the final four candidates included three women and a Hispanic man. Only one of the women had experience working for a public health agency and the man had zero years of health experience, the lawsuit says. Three candidates who were not selected for the final four interviews were white men with numerous years of experience working for public health agencies, according to the lawsuit. On Aug. 9, 2019, the lawsuit says Unland learned through email that Amelia Clark had been chosen for the administrative officer position and had no experience working in a public health agency. The lawsuit says Clark doesn’t have a college degree in health sciences or public health administration. According to the lawsuit, Unland met with the SRHD human resources director on Jan. 31, 2020 and told her he felt he was discriminated against in the selection process. The HR director told Unland she would bring his concerns to the attention of the SRHD attorney and would get back in touch with him, the suit says. The lawsuit says the HR director notified Clark about the discussion and she later notified Ben Wick, the Chairman of the SRHD Board of Health, about Unland’s complaints. Less than two hours after Unland’s discussion with human resources, the lawsuit says Clark sent out an email announcing that she had decided to change the timeline for “action steps for the organizational structure.” On Feb. 4, 2020, Unland was called into a meeting with Clark and HR where he was told he was being laid-off with pay until Feb. 14 and that his job had been eliminated due to reorganization, according to the lawsuit. During the meeting, Clark show Unland the new organizational chart she had drafted which moved his responsibilities to another division and showed four vacancies on the managerial/executive leadership team, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit says Unland asked Clark if he could fill the newly created and vacant position of Associate Director of Community and Family Programs. Clark said the new positions were reserved for less experienced employees for the succession planning efforts of the agency, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit claims Unland was escorted out of the SRHD building without an opportunity to clear out his personal belongings. In April 2020, the lawsuit says SRHD and Clark selected a younger woman to fill the Associate Director of Community and Family Programs. The lawsuit asks for a jury trial and for SRHD to pay for special damages of lost wages, benefits and out of pocket expenses in an amount proven at trial. SRHD’s and Clark’s lawyer filed a response denying the allegations on July 22 saying, “Defendants’ treatment of Plaintiff was at all times for valid, lawful reasons unrelated to his age, gender, race or alleged participation in protected activity.” KREM 2 reached out to SRHD for comment but have not heard back.

9320,https://feminisminindia.com/2020/11/24/bidaai-hindu-wedding-custom-gender-bias/,Bidaai – A Saga Of Emotion... With A Generous Helping Of Gender Discrimination | Feminism In India,"Posted by Tasneem Babat Being locked up at our homes gives us a chance to sit back and reminisce all the good times we had when we could step out. I was reflecting on a friend’s wedding a year ago. What an opulent affair! Enormous lawns, perfectly coordinated colour palettes of décor and linen, fine china, swoon-worthy sartorial elegance, extravagant buffet spreads and the whole enchilada! It got me wondering how antiquated wedding celebrations have evolved over time giving way to more modern options. Most of the basic ceremonies and customs in Hindu Indian weddings still remain the same, portraying the essence of what our Indian society values most. One such custom is the bidaai ritual, which marks the farewell of the bride from her home to her husband’s and in-laws’. However, most of the basic ceremonies and customs still remain the same, portraying the essence of what our Indian society values most. One such custom is the bidaai ritual, which marks the farewell of the bride from her home to her husband’s and in-laws’. So, my friend did have a bidaai, which, needless to say, was an emotional affair. Even I had a lump in my throat, mostly because she was going to be moving to the USA soon after, to join her partner. Also read: Wanted: A Bania-Feminist Consciousness For True Emancipation Witnessing he bidaai ritual, which involved a number of symbolic actions, exuded a daunting aura, like a moment of truth. The word ‘bidaai’ literally means ‘farewell’, so, in a sense, the girl is leaving her parents and maternal family forever, to enter a new household as well as a new role – from a daughter to now also a wife and a daughter-in-law. The girl has to throw a handful of rice behind, which is symbolic of repaying the debt of bringing her up, if that is even possible. In Muslim weddings, a similar custom called ‘rukhsati’ is performed, where the girl is bade goodbye by her family and friends, as she ventures into new relationships. Many East Asian cultures have different nuances of bidaai, where the bride is symbolically expected to leave her parents in order to join her husband. As a simple-minded person, there are two questions that pop up in my mind. One, why is it necessary to jettison old relationships in order to form new ones? Can they not go together? And two, if the girl is leaving her parents, why aren’t the boys in the heterosexual marriage cultures? The dynamics of society are ever-evolving at a rapid pace, and many cultural wedding practices are redundant. For example, today, parents prefer to give the best possible education to their children – boy or a girl. The child repays by being financially independent and tangibly contributing towards their parents’ well-being, be it time-wise, effort-wise or money-wise. So, the act of throwing rice as a token of prosperity and gratitude towards parents, is, well, hollow! If we rewind the world to about four thousand years ago, we would see that marriage itself was an arrangement of convenience for men. To satisfy their physical, sexual and offspring-related needs, women were married off to men by their fathers. If not, it was (and continues to be) seen as an arrangement that would ensure ‘protection’ and ‘security’ for women. As religion became dominant, especially in the Jewish, Christian and Islamic world, marriages became a legalised concept. Couples came together for pragmatic reasons rather than romantic love, and most organised religions maintained that the man was the head of the family whose wishes were, inevitably, kept at the forefront. In India, organised marriages began around three thousand years ago. A shift from the historical Vedic religion towards classical, orthodox Hinduism introduced a patriarchal system where men became the primary custodians of women, from fathers, to husbands, and then to sons. Over the years, due to various reasons, women entered the work force, and did not need to be financially dependent on men. Ironically, in the lower income groups, women sometimes contribute more towards expenses than men. How then, are men still enjoying the status of custodians of women? Of course, the problem is not with the ritual of bidaai, per se, but with the social fabric that encourages customs signifying a relegation of women to the preferences of a man. The notion that wherever the man decides to live, either with his parents or independently, the woman must absolutely follow, is evident in this custom. Bidaai not only euphemises, but also glorifies the absence of a woman’s right to choose her abode after marriage. Recognising this disparity in the social status of men and women, the Indian Constitution has laid down fundamental rights for married women. The Hindu Marriage Act allows a woman to stay at her parental house even after marriage, for any amount of time that she wishes to. She also has equal rights to inherit her parent’s property as her male siblings. Also read: Bahu-Aagman: Of Woman & Familial Harmony In A Marwadi Rasam As a self-respecting, independent woman, I see two ways forward from here: One, doing away with the practice of bidaai. And two, having a similar practice for men. In the face of religious extremists and conservatives building a love jihad narrative, many couples have dared to get married on their own terms, opting for court marriages, prenups, separate bank accounts, status-quo surnames, etc. to protect their individual identities and yet enjoy the spirit of companionship and love without social bondages. It is time that societal expectations keep up with the dynamics of modern marriages and modify traditional customs like bidaai to make them more relevant and meaningful.  With the advent of nuclear set-ups and fluid social and personal commitments, ideally, one should have the freedom to choose their own marriage rituals too.

Discrimination against people of colour and their natural hair. While also tackling the topic of first love (ah the memories) Jamarz has lifted the lid on his own experience and discrimination against him while at school, for the way he wore his hair. Specifically being a proud person of colour of Kenyan descent and being forced to shave his braided hair in high-school, when his white classmates could style their hair how they chose, JamarzOnMarz is also behind a viral petition to stop independent schools discriminating against students through their uniform policies. To date, his petition has gathered more than 25,000 signatures, and the hip hop trailblazer hopes the visual portrayal of events will stimulate the legal change he is fighting for, highlighted in his latest track 'Tomorrow' - a story about his partner and own tale of discrimination. When speaking with the performer he cited Nicki Minaj and Lizzo as his inspirations but also was disappointed that Lizzo is often hitting the headlines because she's loud and proud and looked forward to a day when that wasn't the case and it was more about someone's talent. When speaking about his own journey, the rapper said; ""I’m confident in my messages and what I’ve got to spread, everything has played a role in where I’m at now. It is a bit sad looking at other countries who have already achieved this change when it comes to something like hair, I’m hoping Australia will become a melting pot and understand we're being told to change a part of our culture"".

Iran under the mullahs’ regime has the highest number of executions per capita in the world On Thursday, the Iranian regime’s judiciary carried out four executions in just one prison, thereby reiterating its contempt for universal human rights principles. In another prison one day earlier, the judiciary finally hanged a prisoner who had previously been transferred to solitary confinement on at least two occasions as a form of mock execution. Such tactics of psychological torture are commonplace in Iran under mullahs and will be growing even more prevalent under present conditions. Prominent among those conditions are the regime’s obvious fears of public unrest. This has been a more or less constant fact of life since the end of 2017, when Iran was rocked by the first of three nationwide uprisings. In the face of popular calls for regime change, the regime’s authorities initiated a crackdown, killing around 60 protesters and arresting thousands of others. But this crackdown had but a periodic benefit for the regime, because people’s uprising re-formed and emerged on a national scale once again in November 2019. The second uprising proved to be even larger than the first, encompassing around 200 cities and towns, including many that the regime for long been portrayed to be its strongholds of support. In all of those localities, slogans like “death to the dictator” emerged spontaneously from demonstrations that were initially sparked by the announcement of sharp increases in the price of gasoline. Recognizing and fearing the movement’s rapid spread and strong anti-regime message, Tehran quickly responded by urging the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) to shut down the uprising by any means necessary. Watch this video on YouTube The IRGC opened fire on crowds of demonstrators, and Amnesty International later observed that agents were clearly shooting to kill. The People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), through its both an established intelligence network and given its leading role in protests, set to work calculating the fatalities and identifying the victims. For nearly a year, the MEK has been reporting that Iranian authorities killed approximately 1,500 peaceful demonstrators in a matter of only days in November 2019. That figure was later confirmed in a Reuters report that cited anonymous sources from inside the Iranian regime. Yet, the international community has failed to take concrete steps toward preventing the repetition of such abuses by Iran’s theocratic regime. The international community’s failure in holding the regime’s authorities to account has emboldened the regime to continue its killing spree. In this regard, and while condemning the recent executions, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) urged “the United Nations Secretary General, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Human Rights Council, relevant special rapporteurs and all international human rights organizations to immediately act to stop torture and executions in Iran and to submit the dossier of the Iranian regime’s cruel and systematic human rights violations to the UN Security Council.” It is frankly shocking that such calls have not been heeded at any time in the year since Iran experienced what may have been its worst single crackdown on dissent in more than 30 years. It is even more shocking that the standing record for such crackdowns – set all the way back in 1988 – has received little international attention despite being and obvious foundation for constant domestic repression by the Iranian regime. Pictures of some martyrs of 1988 massacre in Iran In the summer of 1988, that regime carried out a systematic massacre of over 30,000 political prisoners, most of which were members and supporters of the MEK. None of the regime’s official has ever been held accountable for the killings, to say nothing of the regime as a whole. For years, the NCRI has spearheaded efforts to spur an UN-led investigation into this crime against humanity, with the ultimate goal of filing charges at the International Criminal Court against known perpetrators who remain in prominent government positions even today. In absence of such charges, those perpetrators remain free to play a leading role in the regime’s crackdown on dissent following the January 2018 and November 2019 uprisings. And as long as the international community delays in holding criminals ruling Iran to account, the entire regime will continue to defy international human rights standards by way of mass executions, mass shootings, physical and psychological torture, politically motivated arrests, and so far. A set of four executions would be an odd spark for international action against a system whose legacy includes prior sets of hundreds and even thousands. But there must come a time when the accumulated death toll in Iran becomes too much to bear for foreign governments that see themselves as global defenders of human rights. In other words, the international community should act rather than waiting for the next instance of the regime attempting to stamp out dissent en masse.  Unless Tehran is given strong disincentives, another such large-scale crackdown is all but inevitable. Regime authorities themselves have left little doubt about this, insofar as they have been warning one another for the past three years about the looming threat of further public unrest. There is a clear through-line linking the January 2018 uprising to its sequel in January 2019. In a recent retrospective article, the state-owned Resalat daily acknowledged that the society’s restiveness throughout the year 2019 was contributed to “one of the highest levels” of property destruction and clashes with authorities after citizens poured into the streets in November. Resalat also noted that “organized cadres” of the MEK, had taken advantage of those conditions to general public outrage into specific appeals for the mullahs’ ouster. These organized “Resistance units” continue to operate today, despite the regime’s oppressive measures. In fact, their efforts and public support for them have both been amplified, thereby setting the stage for another uprising at some point in the near future. Neither public protest nor the regime’s repression was halted in the wake of last year’s uprising. It would be a dereliction of duty for the United Nations or its member states to act as if they were. Those entities should be planning at this very moment for the day when the Iranian people once again rise up against the regime, and the regime tries to put them down. The underlying conflict has been constantly escalating since the first major clash, and it will continue to escalate until Iranian people’s inevitable victory. History will judge the West for which of these outcomes it helps to realize. Copyright © 2021 NCRI National Council of Resistance of Iran All Rights Reserved.

From rubber ducks to Harry Potter, pro-democracy protesters are getting more creative as they demand the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a new constitution, and reforms to the all-powerful monarchy.  Rubber ducks have emerged as the new symbol of the pro-democracy movement. The large inflatable toys were initially used to mock authorities who sealed off the parliament building, which is situated on a river bank in the capital, Bangkok. When water cannons pummeled the peaceful crowds, protesters used the ducks as improvised shields. The three-finger salute from the dystopian film series ""The Hunger Games"" has become a common sight at protests. The gesture of resistance first emerged in 2014 as a form of silent defiance against the military regime led by Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized power in a coup. Pop culture references have helped demonstrators attract attention from both domestic and international communities. During a rally, a group of activists, known as the ""Bad Students,"" dubbed the government ""dinosaurs"" for their outdated mindset. The activists said they see themselves as ""meteorites"" that push government officials into extinction if they refuse to change. The ""Bad Students"" are also demanding an overhaul of Thailand's lackluster education system. Until recently, the monarchy was considered a taboo topic. Thailand's lese majeste laws makes ""disrespect"" against the monarchy a crime. Protesters staged a Harry Potter-themed rally in August to break the taboo. In J.K. Rowling's magical world, the powerful Lord Voldemort is referred to as ""You Know Who"" or ""He Who Must Not Be Named."" The protest was a clear jab at King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Monarchical reform is by far the most contentious of the movement's demands. In November, demonstrators marched to the royal palace to deliver handwritten letters to the king. When asked what he thought about the protesters, King Maha Vajiralongkorn simply said: ""We love them all the same"" and described Thailand as a land of compromise. Many demonstrators are frustrated at the disproportionate use of force and are marching peacefully to demand justice and an end to violence. So far, six people have suffered gunshot wounds and more than 50 people have been seriously injured. After a violent clash between anti-government protesters, protesters marched to the police headquarters the following day to tag the building with paint. The pro-democracy movement has drawn protesters from a wide-range of interest groups. The movement has also come to embody Thailand's diversity, with thousands of people joining in protests to push for gender equality and LGBT+ rights. Protesters change rally venues at short notice as a popular tactic to confuse police. Authorities on Wednesday stacked shipping containers and set up razor wires in central Bangkok to cordon off the Crown Property Bureau from protesters. But protesters announced a last-minute shift to the Siam Commercial Bank’s headquarters. The king is the largest shareholder of the bank.

Ng broke barriers by becoming the first female general manager among the four major U.S. sports leagues last Friday, NBC Asian America reports, but a racist incident Ng faced 17 years ago has come back into the light. According to ESPN, New York Mets special assistant Bill Singer made derogatory and racist comments to Ng at a 2003 meeting in Arizona. While Singer was eventually fired from the Mets, the incident revealed ‘systemic racism in [baseball].’ Singer ‘mocked her heritage with a fake accent,’ NBC Asian America reports, while also asking, “Where are you from?” Singer ultimately apologized and went on to work with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Washington Nationals. At the time, Ng was with the Los Angeles Dodgers as an assistant general manager. “His conduct was inexcusable and extremely disappointing,” former Dodgers’ general manager Dan Evans said. “Kim handled the entire situation in a professional manner.” According to ESPN, Ng’s career in baseball spans decades, starting with her 1990 internship with the Chicago White Sox. She was also a star shortstop on the softball team of her alma mater, the University of Chicago. Ng had interviewed for general manager positions numerous times in the past, a previous AsAmNews article reports. She successfully joined the Miami Marlins recently, becoming the MLB’s first East Asian American general manager. According to MLB analyst Ron Darling, Ng’s years long struggle was rooted in discrimination. “If you look at her résumé, she should have been on the fast track,” Darling said, NBC Asian America reports. “She was on the slow track, quite frankly, because she was an Asian woman. So it changes all of that today with this hire.” Ng said getting the position came from perseverance, AsAmNews reports. “It made me realize that there really was a glimmer of hope and inspiration for so many,” Ng continued. “If you work hard and you persevere and you’re driven and you just keep going, then eventually your dream will come true.” AsAmNews has Asian America in its heart.

9726,https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-kurds/erdogan-continues-repression-kurdish-political-and-cultural-rights,Erdoğan continues repression of Kurdish political and cultural rights,"The year 2020 has been especially difficult for Turkey’s already embattled Kurdish population. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) continue to imprison Kurdish activists and overturn the democratic will of Kurdish voters at an alarming pace, putting the future of Kurdish political and cultural aspirations in a dire position. As COVID-19 continues to ravage the country, Erdoğan and his allies have cynically used the crisis as a smoke screen to double down on the Kurds, removing elected mayors and banning public displays of Kurdish culture and language. Turkey’s restrictions and disregard for its Kurdish minority, which makes up roughly 20 percent of the population, is not new. Although Erdoğan eased some of Turkey’s systematic anti-Kurdish laws in the mid-2000s, he later went on to walk back many of his reforms in a bid to cater to the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), a party with which he is in a ruling coalition. This dynamic became especially pronounced in the aftermath of the 2016 failed coup, which resulted in an intensification of Ankara’s operations against the Kurds both at home and abroad. The ruling government has curtailed Kurdish language, literature and culture on trumped-up charges ever since. The last year has been particularly difficult for Turkey’s Kurds. Of the 65 mayors elected in last year’s local elections for the Kurdish-led People’s Democratic Party (HDP), Ankara has forced out or detained 59, replacing them with loyal AKP trustees. The large-scale crackdown on the HDP has led its co-chair Mithat Sancar to raise concern that the government will pressure the Constitutional Court to enact a total closure of the political party. Erdoğan ultimately aims to equate the HDP with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – a Kurdish militant group that has waged an armed conflict with the Turkish state for nearly 40 years. Now the HDP, its leaders, its members and its supporters are in danger from the AKP-led government. In September, police arrested 82 HDP-affiliated figures on the false charge of taking orders from the PKK to “incite a rebellion” during the October 2014 Kobane protests, in which security forces killed 31 Kurdish protestors. Meanwhile, in Hakkari, police arrested Leyla Güven, a former deputy from the HDP and one of its most popular figures, on dubious charges of aiding the terrorist actions of the PKK. Their arrests are part of the wide net cast by the AKP in its battle against local and state governments with ties to the HDP – and the charges of association with the PKK show that Erdoğan is magnifying his efforts to paint the HDP as identical to the PKK. Erdoğan’s desire to crush Kurdish political aspirations also reaches into the cultural sphere. Most recently, the governor of Istanbul’s Gaziosmanpaşa district halted the production of a Kurdish-language play in Istanbul on the grounds that its content would “disturb public order”. This is one of many examples of the government utilising outdated laws to suppress the Kurds’ basic civil rights. The mounting pressure is also forcing residents of predominantly Kurdish areas such as Diyarbakir to hold underground Kurdish language classes in order to avoid reprisals from the government. Higher education is also under attack. Turkey’s Council of Higher Education (YÖK) has banned students from writing their dissertations in Kurdish. Diyarbakır’s Dicle University has also backtracked on its use of Kurdish language as a medium of instruction, with the university insisting that it never offered courses taught in Kurdish, despite the claim by former academic Selim Temo that Ankara has changed the language of instruction from Kurdish to Turkish. Kurdish media, like other media outlets critical of Erdoğan, has not fared well under the AKP. As of Oct. 6, the popular Iraqi Kurdistan-based news website Rudaw is banned from operating in Turkey as a result of a controversial social media law passed, further stifling platforms critical of the government. Ankara also heavily censors books in Kurdish or about Kurdish history. In 2018, the Turkish courts banned the distribution and sale of nine Kurdish books detailing the history and struggles of the Kurds on the grounds that they were spreading “terrorist propaganda”. Erdoğan’s draconian anti-Kurdish measures leave no room for doubt that the lifting of restrictions on Kurdish culture or politics that he enacted earlier in his rule was purely a political ploy. His alliance with the MHP and near total adoption of their anti-Kurdish outlook exposes the limits of Kurdish political and cultural rights in AKP-ruled Turkey. Although Turkey’s Kurdish minority aspires to enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other Turkish citizens, the Erdoğan government’s systematic repression of even the most basic of their demands will only exacerbate the Kurdish conflict. © copyright Ahval 2017-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9756,http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2020/nov/05/bill-requiring-racial-discrimination-social-justic/,"Bill requiring racial discrimination, social justice instruction in NJ middle schools passes Assembly","Middle school students in New Jersey would learn about racial discrimination and social justice as part of their social studies lessons under legislation approved Oct. 29 by the State Assembly by a vote of 56-7-9. The measure sponsored by Assembly Democrats Herb Conaway and Carol Murphy would require the New Jersey Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the Amistad Commission, to provide school districts with age-appropriate sample activities and resources designed to enhance students’ overall understanding of issues surrounding racial discrimination and social justice. “We often look to the next generation as a symbol of hope for a brighter future,” Conaway and Murphy said in a joint statement. “To reach that better tomorrow, it’s incumbent upon us to teach our children of both our triumphs and failures, our progress and lingering injustices.” The assembly members added that the new law would require students to learn more about the Black experience beyond what is already offered in schools. “Black history is American history,” they said. “Middle school students typically learn about slavery, the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement, but there’s more we can do to teach children about racial discrimination and social justice issues that are tightly interwoven into the fabric of our past and present. These lessons are too important not to have a place in our classrooms.” Several recent racial incidents have been reported at New Jersey middle schools and high schools. Over the summer a Black mother at Buzz Aldrin Middle School in Montclair reported that her daughter endured two years of racial bullying. The mother alleged that her daughter was bullied online because she is Black. The girl was also assaulted and called racial slurs by white students. Last month during a virtual assembly at Lawrence Middle School, staff shut down the event after a person was online using a racial slur as a username. School officials are investigating to find out who the person was. The virtual assembly was on YouTube and that company is assisting with the investigation along with local police. In 2019, four Black middle schoolers in Lawrence were racially harassed at a football game at Lawrence High School. Two male students were charged with bias intimidation and lewdness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9799,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/11/bridge-year-discrimination-racial-gender-sexual-orientation-princeton,"As students recount discrimination abroad, Bridge Year examines racial equity","In a year of global reckoning around issues of racial equity, Novogratz Bridge Year Program administrators are contemplating their role in this realignment, as they respond to minority students’ claims of racial, gender, and sexuality-based discrimination and harassment during their time abroad. The Daily Princetonian spoke with four Bridge Year alumni who said they had faced such discrimination, emphasizing what they perceived as the program’s failure to prepare them for the experiences they would endure. Earlier this fall, Bridge Year Director John Luria announced that the program, which allows students to embark on year-long experiences abroad before they matriculate to Princeton, would enlist the alumni-run Rested Root Corp, an education firm focused on social justice, to assist in “identifying, understanding, and addressing the oppression that participants of targeted identities have faced while on Bridge Year.” Privately, Rested Root Corp has been speaking with Bridge Year alumni in a variety of affinity group settings. Participants, whose experiences will inform a report that Bridge Year administrators are expected to receive in the coming weeks, have been promised anonymity. In an interview with the ‘Prince,’ Luria said the report will help Bridge Year craft, by the end of this calendar year, an “action plan” to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion. This step comes as Nassau Hall undertakes a broad range of efforts to address systemic racism. Several students have shared their Bridge Year experiences publicly. Dani Samake ’24 and Katrina Nix ’24, who attended the program in India and Bolivia, respectively, have been vocal on social media about racial discrimination they said they faced from locals and fellow cohort members. A number of such incidents led Nix to depart Bridge Year two months early. Sydney Eck ’24, who joined Samake on Bridge Year India 2019, and Jacqueline Lydon ’24, who attended Bridge Year Indonesia, spoke with The Daily Princetonian about their experiences of gender-based and sexual-orientation-based discrimination, respectively. Eck and Lydon are both contributing Features writers for the ‘Prince'. Eck also contributes as a writer for the Prospect section. The students’ allegations do not involve program staff. Instead, their claims speak to how they felt their identities led them to face discrimination within their respective Bridge Year countries. Samake told the ‘Prince’ that she entered the program excited to explore and learn among like-minded peers. The Bridge Year India participant, who spoke openly about her experiences with colorism on Instagram this summer, said anti-Black racism became a “defining facet” of her time abroad — “one that none of the other students could relate to.” Samake said her experiences of discrimination were relentless. She recalled strangers spitting on her at least three times and being almost hit intentionally by a bus, along with numerous other public displays of racism. Samake also spoke about the personal toll of living in a country where skin-lightening products such as “Fair and Lovely” are widely used. “Over time, the racism I experienced in society at large and within my group began to weigh on me. My mental and physical health diminished as I struggled to justify the torment I was going through as a Black woman in an anti-black country by telling myself that I was safe, that I was cushioned by Princeton and the Bridge Year partner company, Where There Be Dragons, and that the travel and educational experiences I was having were worth the struggle,” Samake wrote to the ‘Prince.’ For Eck, the discrimination she encountered centered around gender. “While on the program, I was dismissed by shop owners, harassed, and ignored. During one trip to a temple, an influential guru would not look at me because I was a woman,” Eck told the ‘Prince.’ “On more than one occasion, other girls on the program and I were cornered by motorcyclists while biking home at night, pushing us off the road toward the gutter while laughing and calling things like, ‘Hello! I like you! You are so beautiful, Goree (white girl)!’” Lydon spoke to the ‘Prince’ about her experiences as a queer person and the discrimination she said she faced on account of her sexuality. From an instance of stalking to repeated homophobic sentiments, her queer identity heavily impacted how she experienced the program. She said fear was a consistent component of her time in Jogjakarta, where being beaten or raped “are common consequences of being ‘out.’” As a Black woman, Nix’s experiences echo the claims that Samake made about racial discrimination. Nix said she was shocked to witness the use of blackface during a parade, something she said her cohort was quick to defend. Katrina Nix '24 “I experienced constant micro- and macro-aggressions, extreme white fragility, and constant denial of my experience,” she added. During her time in Bolivia, Nix said she was also called a racial slur by a high school student and “stared at to no end — even stopping entire lines of traffic at times.” In one instance, Nix said she had a dog sicced on her, forcing her to quickly obtain a rabies shot. “This experience was one that I can hardly put into words,” she said. The intensity of her experiences led Nix to cut her program short, leaving two months before completion. In all cases, students wished the program had better prepared them for the environments in which they found themselves. Samake doubted that Bridge Year was ignorant to the circumstances she faced. “The Bridge Year Office knew from past student experiences that Black students face incessant racism in the vast majority of Bridge Year locations, and yet did not adequately prepare me for what life in India would be like,” she said. From a different set of experiences, Eck similarly called for better preparation. “There are elements [of the experience] that were inherently damaging to members of our cohort when coupled with a lack of preparation, awareness, and support from the program,” she said. Asked to respond, Luria told the ‘Prince’ that Bridge Year acknowledges discrimination and injustice as “global concerns” and is committed to preparing students for situations they may face abroad. “While we as a program may not be able to solve these global concerns, there is commitment on the part of the program to prepare students for the challenges that they face while they are abroad and supporting them when they encounter these issues,” he said. Luria described several program components, both at the trip’s outset and throughout, that work to prepare students for their new cultural context. Specifically, he pointed to the program’s orientation and the Where There Be Dragons staff, who are on site to help students navigate new cultural surroundings. While Lydon conceded that her safety concerns might have been unrealistic given her privilege as a foreigner in Indonesia, she said, “the daily anxiety and lack of support system was harmful in itself.” Beyond her fears, Lydon said she faced a reality of homophobia that on-site staff did not have the education to confront. “Program authorities had not been educated about what students might face and were unprepared to support us,” Lydon said. “Both the Bridge Year and Dragons offices need to educate instructors, be better about reaching out to students, open up conversations about privilege, educate participants on how to support each other, and more.” Luria outlined the training that Where There Be Dragons staff undergo to help students navigate their cultural environment and address concerns as they arise. First, he pointed to the Where There Be Dragons instructors’ cultural backgrounds. One of the two head instructors is usually an expat, he said, while the other is almost always a member of the local community. Additionally, he emphasized the resources they rely on, citing “a host of instruction manuals” and training programs that all instructors take over the summer. Luira said the instructors are “really committed to creating an exceptionally supportive environment” and “deeply committed to ensuring the well being of students.” Still, program participants who spoke with the ‘Prince’ said they felt unprepared and undersupported. “The outpouring of care, support, and love from our program directors, Matt Lynn, and others at the BY Office and WTBD was often hindered by structural deficits in a program over a decade old,” Eck said. “The Bridge Year office must provide resources both to protect against the physical dangers students may face on the program and to provide for the mental health needs of all participants.” “They have a lot of work to do,” Lydon added.

Original cast member Carly Hughes exited the ABC sitcom ahead of Season 5, amid a workplace environment she claimed was “toxic” and subjected her to discrimination. Hughes was last billed as a series regular in the graduation-themed Season 5 opener, which was largely leftover from the end of Season 4/before the pandemic. TV's Big Cast Changes (2020-2021) Launch Gallery Katy Mixon headlines Housewife as Katie Otto, a wife and mother who tries to maintain her sense of self and family while dealing with the wealthy, pretentious, arrogant housewives and their privileged children in her new hometown of Westport, Connecticut. Hughes played Angela, one of Katie’s best friends.  “I was no longer able to work in the toxic environment that was created on American Housewife,” Hughes said in a statement obtained by TVLine. “I made the decision to leave to protect myself, from that type of discrimination. As a black woman in entertainment I feel the responsibility to stand up for what I deserve, what we all deserve — to be treated equally. I wish the show well, and I am excited for a new chapter and to be able to pursue the opportunities ahead.” An American Housewife spokesman said in a statement to TVLine, “Carly was a valued member of the cast, and we had hoped she would return to the show this season. The concerns she raised led to positive changes to the workplace and improvements to the culture, but we respect the decision she made to move on. We wish her nothing but the best.” The “positive changes,” our sister site Deadline reports, included demotions for producer Sarah Dunn and line producer Mark J. Greenberg, while showrunners Rick Wiener and Kenny Schwartz underwent sensitivity training. Lest Katie’s circle of gal pals shrink, Holly Robinson Peete was recently cast in the recurring role of Tami, a close friend of Katie’s from before the Ottos moved to Westport. In addition to her four-season Housewife run, Hughes’ TV credits included Netflix’s Insatiable, where she played Etta Mae Barnard, ex-wife of Christopher Gorham’s Bob Barnard.
