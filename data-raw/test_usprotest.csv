He recently became the target of a thief trying to make some quick cash. Now, the Bulldog community is stepping in to help. Channel 2’s Tom Regan talked to the artist about the overwhelming kindness. ""I just look at my art as a blessing from God,” Michael Davenport said. Davenport says he discovered his artistic talent in the wake of a terrible tragedy. While playing outside at age 13, he grabbed some cables that he didn’t know were electrified. “A high voltage power line, 75,000 went through me. I was a little kid trying to be Spider-Man that day,” Davenport said. He lost both of his hands, but two years later, he discovered something he never knew he could do. “So, I started writing with my mouth, and became an artist,” he said. For decades now, he's been sketching bulldog portraits for University of Georgia fans. But last week, police say, someone got out of a van and stole nearly $60 that Davenport had collected from his sketches. He was on a bathroom break. “I (came) back out, I noticed my red donation bowl was gone,” he said. The thief also took his art supplies. But like his art, there was beauty in the response of those who’d heard about what happened. More and more people including Christa Perry started showing up to buy his unique sketches. “He's been around forever, and everybody loves him,” Perry said. A manager at the motel where Davenport lives set up a GoFundMe fundraiser for the artist. The fundraiser page says that the manager received countless phone calls about people wanting to help pay for Davenport’s stay at the hotel, prompting the manager to help Davenport setup a savings account and then the GoFundMe. It says it is to “help him get back on his feet.” It has raised more than $37,000 in donations as of Saturday morning. Caring and generous neighbors have donated thousands of dollars already. Davenport says he is grateful to all who show they care. “It made me feel good inside and let me know God (does) hear some prayers,” he said. Davenport says he hopes his art provides joy and inspiration to others, especially to children. “I’m just trying to show everyone you can be the best you be, with hands or without hands,” he said.   © 2020 Cox Media Group © 2021 Cox Media Group.

A feminist collective performed a Bengali version of the Chilean feminist performance piece, “The Rapist is You” in Kolkata on Saturday as part of the widespread protests against Narendra Modi’s visit to the city. Titled Un violador en tu camino in Spanish, it was composed by a Chilean feminist collective and performed in Santiago in 2019, against the backdrop of widespread anti-government protests. Since then, the song has gone viral, inspiring women around the world to generate their own versions. In Kolkata, it was translated into Bengali and named Dhorshok Tumii. A group of women connected over social media decided to perform it. After a fortnight of rehearsals, mostly in Jadavpur University, the collective performed it for the first time on January 4, outside the city’s iconic New Market. When it was learnt that Modi was going to come to Kolkata, the collective decided to repeat their performance. “We wanted to highlight the patriarchal violence that Modi’s idea of a Hindu Rashtra represents,” said Aopala Banerjee, one of the women who had performed the anthem on Saturday told Scroll.in. The chant was also heard at a flash mob of women outside the courthouse where Harvey Weinstein is going to be tried for sexual abuse.

This week, Fonda found herself marching on Capitol Hill next to recent Golden Globe winner Joaquin Phoenix, who Fonda claims that she didn’t personally invite but “came of his own volition!” He recently (and shambolically) praised the HFPA for offering vegan cuisine at their fancy ceremony. In the process, he also asked his fellow actors to stop taking private jets to film festivals, and he made his points again in D.C. on Friday. “I struggle so much with what I can do [to fight climate change] at times,” he said in this video tweeted by The Hill. “There are things that I can’t avoid — I flew a plane out here today, or last night rather. But one thing that I can do is change my eating habits.” Joaquin Phoenix: ""I struggle so much with what I can do [to combat climate change] at times. There are things that I can't avoid — I flew a plane out here today, or last night rather. But one thing that I can do is change my eating habits."" pic.twitter.com/RaZILYq0La — The Hill (@thehill) January 10, 2020  Phoenix’s general argument is that the mass adoption of a vegan diet would help ease environmental woes, but he was warned (as were all activists) to disperse from the area, which they apparently refused to do. TMZ was among the first to report that Phoenix, soon after making this speech, came under arrest by D.C. police. Martin Sheen, who has played a few U.S. presidents (fictional and otherwise, in The West Wing and a Kennedy miniseries), got nabbed as well. Deadline then confirmed the news. Prior to this development, the Washington Post‘s Hannah Jewell posted some photos and videos while quipping that “the joker is going to be arrested on the steps of the capitol.” As far as anyone’s aware, Phoenix did not do Arthur Fleck’s dance at any point prior to his arrest.

404,https://www.kwch.com/content/news/Family-teen-paralyzed-after-car-crash-in-Reno-County-566914181.html,Buhler community rallies around high schooler paralyzed after crash,"A 16-year-old boy is paralyzed after a car accident Friday in Reno County, according to the family. Deputies say a small pickup truck was traveling westbound on east 4th Avenue when the driver lost control on slick roads and veered into a ditch. The pickup then rolled several times. Raiden Stewart was trapped inside. Hutchinson firefighters extracted Raiden from the pickup, and he was taken to Wesley Medical Center for treatment. His mother, Tara Stewart, says her son Raiden had surgery Saturday. She says he is paralyzed from the chest down and has limited arm movement. He fractured his spinal cord and will most likely not be able to walk again. He also has damage to his vertebral artery. Stewart says her son is a Buhler High School junior who is part of the wrestling and football team. He just took first place at the Douglas Varsity Wrestling Tournament and recently took second place at the Abilene Varsity Wrestling Tournament. Raiden's coaches say he inspired people on the football field and on the wrestling. While the prognosis is difficult, they say Raiden is already making strides in his recovery. ""His mental toughness will probably help carry him along as well. Not just his physical strength,"" said Buhler wrestling coach, Mike Zeyen. ""He has a big heart,"" said Buhler High School head football coach, Steve Warner. ""He knows he can handle it and he's going to fight."" Warner said a lot of students have traveled to see Raiden and his family. His mom is asking for thoughts and prayers in this difficult time. After he is released from the hospital, Raiden will go to a spinal rehabilitation center in either Denver or Omaha. Family and friends have set up a to help with expenses. There is also a fundraiser, set for Tuesday (Jan. 21) from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Spangles located at 120 east 4th Avenue (Hutchinson). Some of the proceeds will be given to the family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
416,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/1/17/pakistani-far-right-activists-sentenced-over-blasphemy-protests,Pakistani far-right activists sentenced over blasphemy protests,"Eighty-six sentenced for violent protests after 2018 acquittal of a Christian woman in blasphemy case. Islamabad, Pakistan – A Pakistani court has sentenced 86 members of a far right religious party to 55-year prison terms each for taking part in violent protests against the acquittal of a Christian woman in a blasphemy case, party officials say. The verdicts were announced late on Thursday night by a court in the northern garrison city of Rawalpindi, Pir Ejaz Ashrafi, a senior leader of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA) party, told Al Jazeera. The 86 TLRYA activists were arrested in November 2018, as the party led violent protests against the acquittal by the country’s Supreme Court of Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman who was on death row for having allegedly committed blasphemy in 2009. Days of protests saw TLRYA activists – led by party leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi – block big highways and destroy public property across the country, but mostly centred in the central province of Punjab. At the time, senior TLP leader Pir Afzal Qadri had called for the judges who announced the acquittal to be killed. The charges against those sentenced include destroying public property, attacking passers-by and disrupting citizens’ everyday life. Ashrafi said the sentences were “harsh” and that his party would be appealing the decision at the high court. “This is the murder of justice. We are hopeful that they will suspend the verdict in the high court, and our legal team is working on it,” he told Al Jazeera by telephone from the eastern city of Lahore, where the TLYRA is based. Bibi, a Christian woman from the central Pakistani village of Ithan Wali, was accused by two Muslim women of having committed blasphemy by insulting Islam’s Prophet Muhammad during an argument over a drinking water vessel in 2009. She spent eight years on death row, with rights groups arguing that there were numerous fair trial concerns in her case, as are commonly reported in most blasphemy prosecutions in Pakistan. In 2018, the Supreme Court acquitted Bibi, ruling that prosecution witnesses had lied to implicate her. In May, she flew to Canada where she was forced to seek asylum to guarantee her and her family’s safety after the verdict. Blasphemy against Islam is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where the crime can carry a mandatory death sentence. Increasingly, accusations have led to violent attacks by mobs or assailants, with at least 75 people killed in such attacks since 1990, according to an Al Jazeera tally. Two of those killed – a sitting federal minister and a serving provincial governor – were attacked for having supported Bibi during her trial. Last month, a court in the central city of Multan sentenced university lecturer Junaid Hafeez to death for blasphemy after a six-year trial. Hafeez has spent most of his incarceration in solitary confinement due to threats against his life, his lawyer says. One of his lawyers, Rashid Rehman, was murdered in 2014 for defending him. The TLYRA has publicly endorsed violence in the name of the blasphemy laws, with a regular chant at protests such as the November demonstrations for which the activists were sentenced on Thursday calling for all blasphemers to be beheaded. Rizvi, the TLYRA chief, is currently out on medical bail as he faces charges of inciting hatred and violence at the rallies. His brother, Ameer Hussain Rizvi, and nephew are among those who were sentenced on Thursday, Ashrafi said. Asad Hashim is Al Jazeera’s digital correspondent in Pakistan. He tweets @AsadHashim.

581,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-says-it-has-made-arrests-over-plane-disaster-after-n1114951,Iran says it has made arrests over plane disaster after days of protests," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News TEHRAN — Iran’s judiciary said Tuesday that it had arrested an undisclosed number of suspects involved in the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane that killed all 176 aboard last week. The announcement came after days of protests shook Iran, with demonstrators railing against the government’s initial attempts to deny involvement in the downing of the plane. Thirty people were arrested during the demonstrations, a judicial spokesperson, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said at a news conference Tuesday. Esmaili gave no further details on the number of those arrested in connection with the downing of the passenger jet and did not reveal their names or professions. He also said that the plane’s black box had been taken to France for the data to be read and that more information would be released. But France’s bureau of aviation investigation confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday that no black boxes had been sent to France and nor were they expected to be. Canada's transportation safety board had said Monday that the black boxes were damaged and remained in Iran. ""We haven't seen the extent of the damage, but extracting the data will pose some technical challenges for the Iranian investigating team,"" the head of the board said. Iran initially denied allegations that a missile had struck the plane shortly after it took off last Wednesday from Tehran, the capital, only to reverse course on Saturday and admit that it had shot down the jet by mistake. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Twitter Saturday blamed “human error” for the “horrific crash.” Over the weekend, the U-turn prompted Iranian protesters to take to the streets demanding that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei step down. Rouhani said that one person could not be held responsible for the downing of the plane and called for a special court to investigate. Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank, said the way in which the government and the establishment handle the broader repercussions of the incident could be a ""watershed moment for Iran."" ""The choices it makes are likely to reverberate throughout Iranian politics and society for months, or even years, to come,"" she wrote in an analysis piece for the BBC. Britain, France and Germany said Tuesday that they were triggering a dispute mechanism that is part of the nuclear deal with Iran, citing its failure to live up to terms of the pact. The foreign ministers of the three nations said in a statement that they were ""left with no choice, given Iran's actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments."" But, they added, their countries would not join a campaign to implement maximum pressure against Iran and hoped that parties to the nuclear accord would find a way forward to resolve the impasse and preserve the agreement. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers eased international sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear program. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in May 2018 and imposed economic sanctions on the country's oil industry, as well as banking and other key sectors.

756,https://www.thequint.com/my-report/khureji-khas-delhi-anti-caa-protest-women-lead,CAA Protest in Khureji Khas Delhi: Women in Khureji Khas Quit Jobs to be Part of Anti-CAA Protest,"More than 1,500 women have joined the sit-in protest against the CAA at Delhi’s Khureji Khas. It’s a gloomy afternoon. The absence of the sun can be felt as the frigid air stings our cheeks. Undeterred by the biting cold, hundreds of women have been gathering at Khureji Khas since 18 January to register their dissent against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Chants of “hum ek hai” (we are one) linger in the bamboo tent, which is decorated with posters and national flags. While Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, a similar sentiment has been echoing among women at Khureji Khas. The movement, which started as a small awareness campaign seeking to put an end to the misinformation, has now grown into a key anti-CAA protest site. Around 1,500 women have been participating at this peaceful gathering on all the days. One of them is 28-year-old Mehnaaz Sheikh, who recently quit her job. Mehnaaz, a resident of Khureji, was an English teacher at a private school. On being asked about her family’s reaction over her decision, she replies, “Even though my family is financially stable, I have always wanted to be independent. This is a sacrifice I made for my country,” she adds. While sharing her experience, Mehnaaz is offered tea by a girl. Braving the winter cold, she holds the paper cup between her palms to absorb its warmth. Just like Mehnaaz, 32-year-old Sadaf, who was working as a receptionist in a private firm, put down her papers. She had to convince her family to let her work in the first place, but after seeing the dadis of Shaheen Bagh, she too decided to quit. Sadaf has been participating in protests across the city ever since. “I stay at these protests all night. I barely know people in my locality, but these women have now become a part of my family,” she says. Thirty-year-old Nazia is another woman who decided to leave her job to participate in the protests. Like Mehnaaz and Sadaf, she too says that quitting her job was a sacrifice she made for her country. “For me, the world revolved around work and home, but for these protests, I have been staying out till 5 am. In these 30 days I have seen parts of Delhi I had never heard of.” There is hardly any place to walk inside the tent. There is a makeshift stage where women wait for their turn to address the crowd. Everyone greets each other with hugs and broad smiles. For a lot of these women, convincing their families to let them work had been a difficult task.While there are many male relatives at the protest site, these women do not fear defying gender roles for a larger cause. They juggle between participating in protests and completing household duties, no matter how sleep deprived they feel. Naima, a homemaker, rocks her sleeping baby in her arms. She says she wishes to give her child a future where his loyalty towards the country will not be questioned. As she participates in the protest for 12 hours, her household duties, she says, have taken a backseat. Several attempts have been made to malign and discredit the protest at Khureji Khas with rumours doing rounds that the women were paid to protest. Shama, a middle-aged woman, dismisses these allegations. “I have everything, why would I come here for money,” she asks. Overhearing our conversation, a woman from the back shouts, “I’ll give them Rs 2,000 if they (ministers) are willing to come here and hear our ordeal!” She recounts news from her hometown in Muzzafarnagar and tears up. Khureji’s women have faced criticism with many saying that the protests have resulted in traffic jams and caused disruption of movement. To shield protests at Khureji, committees were formed to ensure the smooth functioning of the demonstrations. “We have legal, medical, traffic, security and stage committees,” says Amaantullah, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia. As we exit the tent, chants of ‘Azaadi’ resonate in the air, reminding us of an India that is led by its women. (The authors are masters’ students of Convergent Journalism at Jamia Millia Islamia.

Sultana Begum, the great granddaughter-in-law of last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar also joins the rally. “The Mughals rued over India for 800 years but never divided people on religious lines. That is why they could rule for so long. They did not change names of cities. So what gives the BJP government the right to change the names of cities and roads?

908,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cn-rail-shutdown-1.5463266,"Via Rail cancels most trains nationwide, CN closes Eastern Canadian network as Indigenous protests continue | CBC News","CN Rail and Via Rail are shutting down huge sections of their railway networks as Indigenous blockades continue to cripple the country's transportation systems. Via Rail is temporarily ending most passenger services nationwide, expanding an earlier work stoppage that restricted train cancellations to the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal corridor. ""Via Rail has no other option but to cancel all of its services on the network, with the exception of Sudbury-White River (CP Rail) and Churchill-The Pas (Hudson Bay Railway), until further notice,"" the rail operator said in a media statement. The company said it would automatically process full refunds for all cancelled trips. ""You do not need to contact Via Rail to confirm the refund, but note that due to the volume of transactions it may take up to 15 days to receive,"" the Crown corporation said. ""We understand the impact this unfortunate situation has on our passengers and regret the significant inconvenience this is causing to their travel."" CN Rail, the country's largest railway, is ""initiating a progressive and orderly shutdown of its Eastern Canadian network"" because Tyendinaga Mohawk protesters near Belleville, Ont. have so far refused to dismantle their blockade. The railway operator said the shutdown, which will affect the entire network east of Toronto, may result in temporary layoffs of CN workers. Teamsters Canada, the union which represents over 16,000 workers in the rail industry, said Friday the shutdown could lead to roughly 6,000 layoffs. Via Rail trains run on CN tracks in most parts of the country, a vestige of a time when CN ran its own passenger trains. ""With over 400 trains cancelled during the last week and new protests that emerged at strategic locations on our mainline, we have decided that a progressive shutdown of our Eastern Canadian operations is the responsible approach to take for the safety of our employees and the protestors,"" J.J. Ruest, the president and CEO of CN, said in a media statement. ""This situation is regrettable ... these protests are unrelated to CN's activities and beyond our control. Our shutdown will be progressive and methodical to ensure that we are well set up for recovery, which will come when the illegal blockades end completely."" Last weekend, CN Rail obtained a court injunction to end the illegal Mohawk demonstration. The injunction has been ignored by the protesters. Activists also ignored a request from the on-reserve Tyendinaga Police for them to voluntarily dismantle the blockade. The injunction forbids any continued interference with the rail line under the threat of arrest. The Ontario Provincial Police has not yet enforced the injunction. The federal government, which has jurisdictional authority over railways, has so far refused to intervene. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller has agreed to meet with the Mohawks on Saturday. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he plans to meet with his provincial and territorial counterparts Friday, adding he is in contact with CN and CP. In a statement Thursday, Garneau said ""freedom of expression"" is an important democratic right, but added, ""these activities must respect the court decisions and the law."" The Mohawk activists have said they won't end their demonstration until the RCMP leaves the traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en in northern B.C. Wet'suwet'en hereditary leaders had been blocking road access to a construction site for the Coastal GasLink pipeline, a key part of a $40-billion LNG Canada liquefied natural gas export project. While much of the police action near that road ended Tuesday with multiple arrests, the RCMP still has officers stationed near the pipeline construction site. A separate rail blockade on CN tracks near New Hazelton, B.C. was set to end today after Gitxsan hereditary chiefs agreed to end protests designed to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett and her provincial counterpart will hold talks with both the Gitxsan and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs in the coming days. A prolonged shutdown could have devastating consequences for the country's economy. CN moves more than $250 billion a year in goods across its transcontinental network. The shutdown threatens the transport of food and consumer items, grain, de-icing fluid for airports, construction materials, propane supplies for Quebec and Atlantic Canada, and natural resources like lumber, aluminum and coal, the railway said. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce urged the federal and provincial governments and the police to immediately end the transport chaos and help CN restore rail service. ""From propane to grain and food and consumer items, Canada's supply chains are being severely damaged by the continuing interruptions to Canada's rail services by protestors,"" the organization said in a statement. ""The rail system affects the entire Canadian economy and Canadians everywhere, including people trying to get to and from work. They must be allowed to continue to serve the thousands of businesses that depend on them."" Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, said this shutdown could be hugely problematic. ""It's a critical situation. It's an extremely dire situation for the economy and, in the coming days, for communities across the country,"" he told CBC's Power & Politics. He said 80 per cent of his industry's products, such as jet fuel for planes and chlorine for drinking water, are shipped by rail. Masterson said the provincial police need to enforce the court-ordered injunction and clear out the Mohawk protesters. ""Everyone has the right to protest ... but the courts have said, 'You've gone too far, it's no longer in the public interest,'"" he said. ""The actions are illegal, this is trespassing.

As the Delhi assembly elections draw to an end, Shaheen Bagh protesters seem to have vacated the protest site that they had occupied for almost 2 months now, blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares of the national capital in opposition to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act that intends to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. In the run up to the Delhi elections, there were speculations galore that the protest that had continued for more than 55 days, causing grave inconvenience to the lakhs of daily commuters will vanish just after the elections concluded. The speculations now appear to have turned true as a large number of regular protesters at Shaheen Bagh have deserted the protest site on Tuesday morning and did not turn up for what they claimed their democratic right to protest against the government’s move to bring in the CAA. Since December 15, 2019, protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh and blocked one of the arterial roads in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protest site was accused of being an independent enclave where participation of people was regulated based on their political inclinations and past predispositions. It also witnessed anti-India and pro-Azaadi slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. The Aam Admi Party is well poised to secure a thumping majority in the 70-seats Delhi assembly to stake a claim at the government while the BJP is expected to win 15-20 seats.

1008,https://fox4kc.com/news/community-rallies-to-give-local-vietnam-veterans-with-no-living-relatives-a-proper-funeral/,Community rallies to give local Vietnam veterans with no living relatives a proper funeral,"FOX 4 Kansas City WDAF-TV | News, Weather, Sports by: Sean McDowell  LEAVENWORTH, Kan. — It’s a tragic sign of the times. Many U.S. military veterans of the Vietnam War era are passing on, and some are passing on with no remaining relatives to bury them. On Thursday, a community banded together to give two fallen patriots a special sendoff. They were unknown to many, but people in Leavenworth wouldn’t let them be forsaken either. Leavenworth National Cemetery hosted around 100 people Thursday to say farewell to retired U.S. Army Prt. Arlen Zimmerman and Spc. Thomas Winstead, two soldiers who served in Vietnam. Both men died since November 2019, leaving no known blood relatives behind. Cars entering the cemetery lined up, carrying people who’d rallied the effort to ensure Zimmer and Winstead wouldn’t have an empty funeral. “I thought it was just going to be me and my wife. I really did,” Kansas City resident Mike Pence said. Pence, also a U.S. Army veteran, is believed to be the only person in attendance who knew either man. “I just couldn’t have wished for something better for him. The respect and the ceremony was beautiful,” Pence said. “This overwhelmed me.” Staff members from the Veterans Administration accepted a ceremonial American flag, delivered by a military honor guard, on behalf of Winstead’s estate. Current and former military members came to share a solemn salute. “The type of war they faced in Vietnam left them fairly alone in their personal lives and their families, battling addiction or depression,” U.S. Navy Lt. Houston Benson said. “It’s fairly uncommon for people to be buried alone, but in this particular war, it’s more common than it should be.” “It broke my heart because no human being should be buried with no one. I decided they took the call of duty and went, so I thought I could do the same thing,” Retired U.S. Navy officer Stephen Lopez said. As many as 100 people showed up on a cold afternoon to say goodbye to two men they’d never met before. Virtually every branch of the U.S. military was represented, members who agreed there’s something special about the people who came out to pay their respects to these fallen veterans. “When you’ve been in a war, and you lose so many friends, you know all the guys — maybe not personally, but you live with them. We’re all the same,” Lopez added. “He was an amazing guy. He deserved something incredible like this,” Pence said. The VA pays for the burial of fallen soldiers as part of their death benefits. However, people in attendance Thursday praised the Muehlbach Funeral Home, which helped coordinate the memorial service. Submit Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

And that is nothing new—hundreds of dogs are spooked by vacuums on a daily basis, and society refuses to offer so much as a ‘there, there.’ Some repulsive pet owners even go so far as to post videos of their dogs getting spooked by vacuums as if life-threatening trauma is funny. Would you find a video of a toddler being waterboarded funny? The manufacturers responsible for this sonic excruciation machine should be thrown in jail.” Neither Hoover executives nor Ruffles the dog could be reached for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the Thousand Islands Bridge to the U.S. was temporarily blocked, with authorities telling people to find an alternative route rather than clearing out the blockage. And now, sections of Bloor St. have been shut down as demonstrators ‘in solidarity’ with the illegal blockades blocked the road: “DEMOBloor St closed from Bathurst St to Shaw – large group of participants– police will assist with movement of this march#GO339896^mf” DEMOBloor St closed from Bathurst St to Shaw – large group of participants– police will assist with movement of this march#GO339896^mf — Toronto Police Operations (@TPSOperations) February 17, 2020  “DEMONSTRATION:S/B Bay St at College St– birds eye view of demonstration from @TorontoPoliceHQ– officers o/s assisting with traffic & crowd control– demonstrators have stopped at the intersection of Bay/College– expect delays– consider alternate routes#GO339896^al” DEMONSTRATION:S/B Bay St at College St– birds eye view of demonstration from @TorontoPolice HQ– officers o/s assisting with traffic & crowd control– demonstrators have stopped at the intersection of Bay/College– expect delays– consider alternate routes#GO339896^al pic.twitter.com/0aKGy8V2oL — Toronto Police Operations (@TPSOperations) February 17, 2020  Of course, there’s a huge difference between the illegal blockades and a regular street protest. But as I noted above, a border crossing was already temporarily shut down – which is clearly an illegal act. This is no surprise. Weakness invites further challenge, and by refusing to enforce the laws, the Trudeau Liberals have shown immense weakness. Lawbreakers, radical blockaders, have been given reign over our railways, shutting them down with impunity and without consequence. As a result, more and more radicals will be emboldened to violate the law, and the biggest victims of all this will be the hard-working law-abiding Canadian taxpayers who pay the bills for this country.

Soraka has taken over the top lane this patch. Over these past few weeks, top lane Soraka has become a strong pick in both the professional and casual League of Legends scenes. Unfortunately for anyone who wanted to try her out, however, Riot Games has already confirmed that it will be nerfing her soon. Riot’s senior champion designer August Browning said that the Starchild has one of the highest win rates of any top lane champion in the game. And as a result, the League of Legends developer will be sending some nerfs to her kit in the upcoming patches. “It’s not like it’s not cool. It’s cool that characters go to other lanes,” Riot August said. “But Soraka top right now has a 56 percent win rate…She’s the strongest champion you can play top except for Sett.” What makes Soraka so strong in the top lane is her ability to sustain with low mana cost abilities that heal herself for a significant amount. She can negate any trade damage with her Q’s self-healing and movement speed, and go relatively even with most top lane champions. Related: Top lane Soraka: An in-depth guide Later on in the game, Soraka is able to hit her inexpensive item spikes a lot sooner, since she’s soaking up more gold and experience. She and her team can then group up and teamfight with ease, especially with the massive heals that she can dish out to her teammates. Soraka top was recently picked up in the LEC by none other than G2 Esports. Although they locked down the win off the back of a huge carry performance from Luka “Perkz” Perković on other champions, Soraka has become so strong that even pro players have begun putting some priority on the Starchild as a pick.

1408,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-02/jane-fonda-brings-climate-change-protests-to-los-angeles,Jane Fonda brings climate change protests to Los Angeles,"Jane Fonda had a scheduling problem, the collision of two important parts of a very busy life. The Oscar-winning actor had moved from Century City to Washington, D.C., in September, intent on a mission: to raise awareness of climate change. She protested on the U.S. Capitol grounds in a bright red coat — purchased on sale at Neiman Marcus — was arrested five times, spent a night in jail with a herd of scurrying cockroaches. But she was under contract for the seventh and final season of her comedy series, “Grace and Frankie.” Being half of the title, she couldn’t just bail. She asked for a hiatus in filming. Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, “looked at me like I was crazy,” she said. “He’s a good guy, but he’d already signed all the contracts.” Her four months of weekly protests in the nation’s capital, called Fire Drill Fridays, came to an end in January. But they “had been transformative,” the 82-year-old told 150 or so mostly millennials Saturday afternoon in West Hollywood. “And when the time was coming to an end, I started to get real depressed. I’m going to have to leave and go back to business as usual.” Which is how the California version of Fire Drill Fridays was born. Starting Feb. 7, Fonda will kick off a series of monthly Golden State protests with a rally on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall. There will be celebrities — Norman Lear and Rita Moreno, among others — speeches, a march and a little civil disobedience at a venue to be named later. Future events are planned for Wilmington, Bakersfield and other cities. Washington had the White House as backdrop, legislators to persuade and a ready army of television cameras. But California is strategic, she told members of The Wing, a women’s co-working space. Lots of oil extraction, lots of fossil fuel consumption, a reputation as a national environmental leader and a reality that could use some help. “I’m really happy that we’re here,” said Fonda, urgent and intense. “This is the place we can really emphasize stopping the drilling and the fracking.” She said she wants Gov. Gavin Newsom to put an end to new oil-drilling permits in the state. She paused. Smiled. And continued in a conspiratorial whisper: “We’re meeting with him, by the way, next Thursday.” The women’s laughter drowned her out. “Oil rules in California. It’s very hard for politicians to stand up to Big Oil. But that’s where leaders come from.” Fonda has spent most of her adult life juggling two full-time careers: as an actor with dozens of movies, documentaries and television shows under her very small belt; and as an activist, supporting women’s rights, the antiwar movement, the United Farm Workers, the Black Panthers, Native American rights, reproductive rights and the environment, among other causes. Climate change, she said in an interview after the West Hollywood event, “brings it all together. .... It may look like, in my life and my history as an activist, there have been a lot of different things, [but] they’re all connected.” Fonda said she’s been supporting indigenous rights in tribal country since 1970. Today, she said, much of that same land contains “so much fossil fuel, so much of the materials that the oil companies want to extract, that they are front-line communities now in the war against fossil fuel.” Annie Leonard is executive director of Greenpeace USA, which is part of the Fire Drill Friday effort. She said Fonda has “a phenomenal ability to draw new people into the movement, especially women over 50. She did [the Washington protests] for 14 weeks. ... Hundreds and hundreds of people came.” Fonda said she sees herself and other celebrities as “repeaters,” the antennae on the tops of mountains that pick up communication signals and transmit them to wider audiences. “I don’t do the science,” she said. “I don’t do the research. I’m not the wonk. But I can pick up the signals of the people in Wilmington or the scientists in their labs and expand their voices. That’s what I think the role of someone like me is.” Among her biggest regrets, Fonda has said repeatedly through the years, was posing on an anti-aircraft gun during a tour of North Vietnam in 1972, which earned her the nickname Hanoi Jane. She has been proudest, she said Saturday, of Fire Drill Fridays, which are the joy of her ninth decade. “Ten thousand people have signed up to take it nationally,” she said. “I had no idea that this was going to happen. It was an instinct. I may be famous and white and privileged, but when I feel a need for something, I find there’s usually a whole lot of people who feel the same need. ... With Fire Drill Fridays, the rallies, the civil disobedience, the risking arrest, appealed to a whole lot of people.” In her daily life, Fonda says, she does her best to be environmentally minded. She bought a Prius when they first appeared and switched to an electric car last year. Meat once a month, fish, twice. No single-use plastics. The red coat she bought for the protest was the last piece of clothing she plans to purchase, she said, with the exception, perhaps, of some underwear and socks. When you see her at the Oscars on Feb. 9, she’ll be wearing a dress that’s a decade or so old, an Elie Saab number she’s already worn on the red carpet at Cannes. “I haven’t changed sizes, and I have a closet full of clothes,” Fonda said. “I don’t need anything. So If I don’t need anything, I’m not going to get it.” But she won’t be getting arrested in Los Angeles on Friday.

1485,https://www.kxl.com/trucker-convoy-heads-to-salem-to-protest-cap-and-trade-bill/,Trucker Convoy Heads To Salem To Protest Cap And Trade Bill | KXL,"Salem, Ore. – Oregon’s timber workers are preparing for a convoy to the Capitol. They’ll be coming from all over the state, driving to Salem first thing in the morning to protest the new Cap and Trade bill. The bill is aimed at reducing Oregon’s carbon emissions, but loggers and other trade workers say the gas tax part of the bill will hit them especially hard. The group Timber Unity on Facebook has about 53,000 members. They believe Oregon can reduce carbon emissions without any new taxes. They’ll present their own plan to do that today. KXL’s Rosemary Reynolds is talking with truckers at the weigh station in North Plains and will have more on the story throughout the day. Check out these photos from Rosemary:  One couple on their way to Salem this morning is Dawn and her husband. They’re longtime small business owners in East county and have never been politically active until now. Dawn tells KXL’s Jacob Dean they’ll be volunteering, helping to setup in Salem later this morning. On the other side of the issue – some Rural Oregonians strongly support the Cap and Trade bill. Meghan Kemple is the Director of the Oregon Climate and Agriculture Network. She says over 250 stake holders like farmers and ranchers from across Oregon have signed a letter in support of the proposal. She tells KXL’s Mike Turner, significant changes have been made to the policy that will protect rural communities and address concerns. Like rising fuel costs will actually phase in over time. Meanwhile, a Republican lawmaker in Salem says Democrats are making another GOP walkout likely, because of amendments they added to a cap and trade bill. Senator Fred Girod tells the Statesman Journal the bill which would raise fuel prices to cap greenhouse gases, is even worse than the original, that led to a Republican walkout last year, which denied Democrats a vote on the bill. © 2021 Alpha Media LLC.All Rights Reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Washington Examiner reports President Trump said that, even if he wins reelection in November, he will continue to hold rallies across the country. Speaking last Friday at an Opportunity Now Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, the president touted his economic achievements and said his boisterous rallies would continue into a second term. “Can you believe how fast we’re going? We’ll keep the rallies going if we win. Even when we win next time, we’ll do rallies,” Trump told the crowd, which at one point in his speech chanted, “Four more years.” WATCH:  FULL EVENT:  This article first appeared on TheConservativeOpinion.com For more breaking news click here.

1814,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-refuses-halt-rallies-coronavirus-surges-032735605.html,Trump refuses to halt rallies as coronavirus surges," Palm Beach (United States) (AFP) - US President Donald Trump signaled Saturday that he has no intention of halting campaign rallies despite surging coronavirus infections, as a case was confirmed for the first time within miles of the White House. The president struck a defiant tone as he spoke to reporters about the outbreak at his Mar a Lago resort in southern Florida, where he was hosting his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro. ""We will have tremendous rallies and we're doing very well, and we've done a fantastic job with respect to that subject,"" Trump responded when asked if his ""Keep America Great"" campaign events would continue. Trump's remarks came as the number of cases confirmed across the United States leapt past 400, with 19 deaths confirmed so far, mainly in the west coast state of Washington. Meanwhile health authorities announced the first confirmed case in the nation's capital -- a Washington DC resident in his 50s with no history of international travel and no close contacts with anyone known to be infected. Asked if he was concerned that the virus had spread to within a few miles of the White House, Trump replied: ""No, I'm not concerned at all."" The president had already insisted as he visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday that the risk of having so many people in close proximity ""doesn't bother me at all."" The CDC warns on its coronavirus web page against people congregating in crowds and encourages the elderly, in particular, to stay home as much as possible. Trump has been holding rallies -- which attract many senior citizens -- at a rate of more than one a week recently, often as counter-programming to Democratic primary contests or debates. However, his website currently indicates ""no events scheduled"" for the coming days, without giving a reason. Trump has been heavily criticized for repeatedly contradicting the advice of his administration's own experts in his public pronouncements about the coronavirus. At a freewheeling news conference at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, the president claimed falsely that tests for the virus were available for anyone who needed one. The event was intended to update the public on the epidemic. Instead, the president made headlines by calling the governor of the worst-hit state, Washington, a ""snake,"" revealing that he preferred to keep sick Americans on a stranded cruise ship to keep the infection numbers down, complained about CNN and revealed that he was surprised to discover that people could die from the flu. More than 100,000 people have been infected globally by the new coronavirus, with more than 3,500 deaths announced so far, mainly at the epicenter in China. Trump's potential Democratic challengers for the presidency in November, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden have also continued to hold campaign events attracting large crowds during the crisis.

1825,https://cosmicmagazine.com.au/news/led-zeppelins-robert-plant-cancels-on-danish-festival-to-protest-whaling/,Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant Cancels On Danish Festival To Protest Whaling - Cosmic," Led Zeppelin‘s Robert Plant has canceled an upcoming G! Festival appearance in protest of an annual whaling practice known as grindadráp (the “Grind”). G! Festival, is a yearly event held at the seaside village of Gøta on the Danish archipelago of the Faroe Islands. Coinciding with the festival the Grind sees over a thousand pilot whales and dolphins driven to the shores of local beaches and slaughtered by island residents. While the Grind is a thousand-year-old tradition, the manner in which it is conducted is considered by animal rights activists as appallingly cruel. “When whalers locate the whale pods,” local Rannvá Johansen has shared of the event to BluePlanetSociety.org, “they are driven ashore, [which can take] a very long time. The whales then get stressed and the entire whale family can see each other being killed and hear screaming from their babies. They can only wait for themselves to feel the knife.” Plant was set to perform at the festival on July 18th, However, G! Festival has now announced via its official website that the Led Zeppelin vocalist and new backing outfit Saving Grace will no longer appear after having the cull brought to their attention by environmental advocacy group Blue Planet Society. “We’re disappointed and annoyed with the cancelation,” G! Festival’s managing director Sigvør Laksá has shared via the events official website, “We’ve been excited and happy with the massive interest and the positive reception to the announcement of Saving Grace, especially the Robert Plant fever that naturally comes with it.” “It seems somewhat unprofessional for these acts to pull out of a booking without any prior notice or attempt at constructive dialogue which might have allowed us to address the artist’s concerns,” Laksá continues, “It also appears contradictory when an artist is happy to play in countries like Norway and Iceland [which carry out commercial whaling], which Mr. Plant has done in the past, even in 2019.” “This is a severe blow for the festival,” Sigvør concludes, “which forces us to rethink our approach in producing the G! Festival.” Plant, who has not publicly commented on the cancellation, is not the first major act to cancel an appearance at the festival after having the cull brought to their attention. Pop singer Lewis Capaldi and American rapper Princess Nokia have also declined to appear at the festival in wake of the information coming to light. Fatboy Slim donated his booking fee for the event to marine conservation causes after later being informed. You can sign a petition to end the cull here.

1979,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/10/bernie-sanders-campaign-cancels-ohio-rally-tuesday-due-to-coronavirus-concerns.html,Coronavirus outbreak: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden cancel Cleveland rallies," Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden's presidential campaigns canceled rallies set for Cleveland on Tuesday night due to coronavirus concerns, the first disruptions the outbreak has caused in the 2020 Democratic primary. In separate announcements, the Democratic presidential contenders' campaigns said they exercised caution about holding large public gatherings after hearing guidance from public health officials. Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns thanked supporters who planned to attend the events on a crucial day in the race to decide who faces President Donald Trump in November. In a statement, Sanders communications director Mike Casca said the Vermont senator's campaign will evaluate future events ""on a case by case basis."" Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said the campaign will ""make announcements about future events in the coming days."" The Democratic front-runner plans to deliver remarks at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:30 p.m. ET. Asked Tuesday about Trump's plans for future rallies, Vice President Mike Pence said the campaign would make decisions ""literally on a day to day basis."" He added that he is confident the campaign ""will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward."" The cancellations come at a pivotal time for the rivals jockeying for position in the Democratic primary. Six states, including crucial Michigan, hold presidential nominating contests on Tuesday as Biden tries to amass enough delegates to pull the Democratic nomination out of Sanders' reach. Ohio, which awards a significant 136 pledged delegates, votes next week. Read more: Biden and Sanders' fight over trade is a war for the future of the Democratic Party Questions have swirled about when the outbreak would affect a closely watched and consequential Democratic primary. Mass gatherings where the virus could spread make up a core part of Sanders' strategy. Biden relies less on rallies than his rival. Washington state, one of the areas in the U.S. most affected by the outbreak, holds its primary on Tuesday. While voters cast ballots by mail and will not physically go to the polls and risk spreading coronavirus, the state told voters not to lick envelopes. At least 808 people in the U.S. have been infected with the virus, and at least 28 have died from it, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Got a confidential news tip?

1984,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-turning-maga-rallies-slick-locally-targeted/story?id=69256977,"Trump campaign turning MAGA rallies into slick, locally targeted TV ads","It's the latest way the campaign is working to capitalize on Trump's rallies. Bipartisan concern grows over federal response to coronavirus outbreak While President Donald Trump delivered a fiery speech at his South Carolina rally Friday night, blasting Democrats and defending his administration’s coronavirus response, his campaign was working to turn the event into a slick, locally focused TV ad that will soon run in the area. It’s part of the re-election team’s new strategy to flip the president’s sprawling campaign rallies into locally centered TV ads that air days after his road show has left town. The strategy is geared toward further extending the reach and media attention that Trump rallies already generate. The campaign has produced and run six-figure ad buys after rallies in New Hampshire, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado -- with plans to roll run another local ad highlighting Trump's North Charleston rally, a senior Trump campaign official told ABC News. The president tweeted out a version of the South Carolina ad but the campaign hasn’t announced its placement or a buy yet. According to ad service firm CMAG, the Trump campaign placed a $139,000 ad buy in Nevada to run over the next two weeks, and spent $188,760 in Colorado for the week of Feb. 25-Mar. 2. The ads themselves serve as a 90-second highlight reel recapping each rally, carefully curated by the campaign to air in local markets. They promote issues specific to each state like immigration in Nevada and record low unemployment in South Carolina. The Arizona ad features the viral video of a World War II veteran being carried to his seat at the Phoenix Trump rally. The new ads mostly omit the attacks the president heaves at his Democratic rivals, and instead showcase interviews conducted by the campaign with supporters, as well as local news coverage, while sticking mostly to pre-written sections of the president's stump speech -- shying away from highlighting the president’s off-script and polarizing moments. “It is an interesting way to keep the campaign’s message on track,” Vanderbilt political scientist John Geer, whose research focuses on political advertising, told ABC News. “It is also an approach that works better for the president, since he often steps on his message.” Geer also questioned the ads' impact, given that voters' views of Trump are largely set. ""If you consider what happened in South Carolina, Tom Steyer would certainly question the power of ads, in general, to influence the public,"" Geer said, pointing out that the billionaire massively outspent Joe Biden in the state, only to see the former vice president get four times the vote he did. However, the Trump campaign has said they've yet to fully dive into their planned persuasion ad plan. ""We haven't even really started -- we haven't run $1 of persuasion advertising, really. We've done some but like nothing like what we're going to do over the next six months,"" a senior Trump campaign official said. And while locally focused ads aren't a new strategy for a presidential campaign, the new ads are the latest way the Trump campaign has found to extend the impact and maximize the return on investment of the president's rallies. “We just continue to try to get every ounce of value out of the rallies,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News. “We know there are many thousands of people who were unable to get inside the rally and we want to make sure they could share in the excitement a little bit.” The campaign views the president's rallies as more than just one-day events. Top surrogates like Vice President Mike Pence or Donald Trump Jr. hold local events in the days leading up to the rally, campaign staff travel the day before and flood the local media markets -- and now, in the days following the event, the campaign runs a local TV ad that was shot entirely at the rally in that market. And with each rally, the campaign also collects troves of data through everything from online ticket requests to selling merchandise inside the arena -- which can sometimes inform the team where to head next. After holding a rally in El Paso, Texas, in early 2019, the campaign said they noticed a large number of supporters coming over from New Mexico for the event -- and a few weeks later the president was in Rio Rancho. While Trump's re-election campaign has traded the retail politics of diner stops for rock concert-style rallies, the president is set to take part in his first town hall of the election cycle next week on FOX News.

Delhi Police forcefully evicted the protesters from Shaheen Bagh after they showed some resistance. Only a few women protesters were still at the Shaheen Bagh site while the others had left and kept only their slippers to show solidarity. FOLLOW CORONAVIRUS LIVE UPDATES Police have detained 6 women and 3 men from Shaheen Bagh for violating Section 144 prohibitory orders. DCP South East said, ""People at the protest site in Shaheen Bagh were requested today to clear the site as lockdown has been imposed. But after they refused, action was taken against violators as the assembly was unlawful. Protest site has been cleared. Some protesters have been detained.""  #WATCH Delhi Police clears the protest site in Shaheen Bagh area, amid complete lockdown in the national capital, in wake of #Coronavirus pic.twitter.com/N6MGLTLs5Z  Before the evacuation Delhi Police heightened security at Shaheen Bagh and imposed Section 144 under CrPC. Security has also been heightened in Jaffrabad where the violent riots broke out in January. Similar anti-CAA protests that were going on at other sites in Delhi have also been cleared, including Hauz Rani, Jamia University, Jaffrabad and Turkman Gate. Some people have been detained in these areas. Paramilitary forces have been deployed in all these areas after Delhi Police started enforcing the lockdown around 7-8 am on Tuesday. As the coronavirus outbreak spread and Delhi went on lockdown, most of the protesting women at Shaheen Bagh had left the protest site. Only a few remained continuing with their demand asking the Centre to repeal the controversial citizenship law. The Delhi government put the national capital on lockdown since 6 am on Monday and all public transport and non-essential services have been suspended till March 31. On Sunday, some unidentified men hurled ""inflammable substance"" near the site of anti-citizenship law protest in Shaheen Bagh but none of the five women protesters present there were injured.

Not big, not clever, and not what will beat the coronavirus. Photo: Twitter Bad, bad behaviour is this. Hundreds of shoppers have been filmed filling up their trolleys at Makro and emptying shelves at will in a bid to stockpile goods during the coronavirus pandemic. Other department stores have also been hit by the chaos, but the aforementioned retailer became the venue of choice for our hoarders. Honestly, there’s not much we can say in support of the stockpilers. Especially those who ran to the store during business hours on a Monday. Vital supplies, such as toilet paper, cleaning items and hygeine-related products, have all been mercilessly gobbled up. The aisles have been left bare in several stores. Granted, it’s not exclusively a South African problem. But it’s still enough to tip ordinary South Africans into apoplexy. There will be people who can’t get access to necessary supplies because of Monday’s madness. Makro did issue a statement on their coronavirus procedures, but they made no reference to the stockpilers. “Makro has various measures in place to maintain a clean and healthy environment in our stores, and we have ramped these up even further. we are dedicated to keeping our stores stocked and prices fair. “We are working especially hard to replenish hand sanitisers, cleaning supplies, paper products, and other in-demand items as quickly as possible and at our everyday low prices.

2144,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/protest-front-street-pdac-mining-industry-convention-toronto-1.5481698,Large crowd blocks downtown street in protest against mining industry convention | CBC News,"About 200 people took over a downtown street on Sunday afternoon to protest against an annual mining industry convention in Toronto. As police officers watched, the protesters rallied on Front Street outside the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, where delegates had gathered for the opening day of the convention of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada. The protesters held banners, chanted ""Shame!"" and listened to speakers condemn Canadian mining industry companies for allegedly violating human rights and environmental laws in countries outside Canada in which they operate. ""I think, every day, the ecological crisis gets worse,"" Kirsten Francescone, a member of MiningWatch Canada, told reporters as the rally got underway. ""We definitely cannot think that more destructive mines that violate human rights and destroy people's environments is our way out of that ecological crisis. I am really concerned that the mining industry is using this space to say that we need mining to save us from climate change. We're here to say that shouldn't be the case,"" she added. ""We want other kinds of ways forward for a better future for all of us."" Rachel Small, a member of the Mining Injustice Solidarity Network, said it is important to stand up to what she believes is violence perpetuated by the mining industry. ""We are here in front of the world's biggest mining convention,"" Small said. ""Toronto is here to say no to business as usual with this industry continuing. We know what the Canadian mining industry looks like. We know that their business as usual is literally leading us to an unlivable planet. We cannot allow this to continue,"" she said. ""We are here in solidarity with every community around the world that has faced down the barrel of a gun for daring to say no to a Canadian extractive project."" Small said the protesters came to the rally to disrupt the convention. At one point, the protesters attempted to enter the convention but were stopped by police. They did, however, block different entrances to the building for about an hour. She said the protest was held in part to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline that would cut through their traditional territory in northern B.C. ""Canada is a country founded on the removal of Indigenous people for extractive projects. That's exactly what's happening right now on Wet'suwet'en land and that's exactly what Canadian mining projects are doing all over the world,"" she added. On Sunday, one chief and senior government ministers said they have reached a proposed agreement over land title but debate continues over the pipeline. The dispute has led to solidarity protests and rail blockades across the country. More than 50 organizations endorsed the rally. Organizers said many of the companies that provide economic support for the Costal GasLink pipeline project in B.C. also take part in the mining convention. Sponsors of the four-day conference include such mining companies as Vale, Hudbay, Barrick Gold, Teck and BHP. The association has 7,500 members. In recent years, the convention has attracted more than 25,000 people from 131 countries.   With files from Natalie Nanowski, The Canadian Press Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

The Yogi Adityanath government's ""name and shame"" campaign came to an abrupt halt today as the Allahabad High Court ordered that all posters and hoardings naming those accused of violence during protests against the controversial citizenship law be immediately removed. Citing the Right to Privacy as a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations as well as the Supreme Court, the judges said the government's move to display photographs and personal details of the accused on roadside hoardings was ""an unwarranted interference in privacy"". The Lucknow administration has to give a compliance report on the removal to the registrar general by March 16, the court said. Sources said the hoardings – in which the persons named were asked to pay for damage to public property and warned that their property would be attached otherwise -- were put up on instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The High Court had taken up issue on its own, asking the government to explain its position during a rare hearing on a Sunday, a court holiday. Senior advocate KK Rai, who attended the initial hearing at 10 am, said Chief Justice Govind Mathur had made some strong remarks on the issue, saying the government was ""impinging on privacy, respect and freedom"" and called it an ""illegal move"". Today, responding to the government's contention that the court ""erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction"", the judges said, ""Courts are meant to impart justice and no court can shut its eyes if a public unjust is happening just before it"". The judges said they were not concerned with ""validity of the compensation fastened, but to the act about disclosure of personal details of the accused persons"". ""In the present case, the cause is not about personal injury caused to the persons whose personal details are given in the banner but the injury caused to the precious constitutional value and its shameless depiction by the administration. The cause as such is undemocratic functioning of government agencies which are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values,"" the judgment read.  Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar, who was one of the people named in the hoardings, welcomed the judgment. Calling the government's move an effort to compromise the rule of law, she said the move of the court sets an example and ""reinforces our faith in the country's constitution"". ""The damage is already done. This is a digital age. But this is a moral victory for us,"" said Deepak Kabir, theater artist and another accused in the matter.

2214,https://www.altpress.com/news/billie-eilish-body-positivity-message/,Billie Eilish sheds baggy clothes to protest body shaming at tour kickoff,"Eilish's next show is in Orlando, FL on March 10. Billie Eilish kicked off the first leg of her WHERE DO WE GO? World Tour on March 9 in Miami, FL. In addition to rocking the house with a lengthy 22-song set, the 18-year old singer also made a powerful statement regarding body positivity. Billie Eilish dominated 2019. In addition to dropping her debut length record WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? she also became the first woman to ever sweep the four main categories at the Grammys. Eilish has always been outspoken about body positivity and anti-body shaming. Since breaking through, Eilish has rocked her trademark baggy clothes-style. Speaking in a Calvin Kleins ad last May, Eilish explained her reasoning for the fashion choice. “I never want the world to know everything about me. I mean, that’s why I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an opinion because they haven’t seen what’s underneath. Nobody can be like, ‘she’s slim-thick,’ ‘she’s not slim-thick,’ ‘she’s got a flat ass,’ ‘she’s got a fat ass.’ No one can say any of that because they don’t know.” Now, Eilish is continuing her sentiments in a powerful, new video interlude she debuted at the start of this tour. The video occurred just before Eilish kicked into “all the good girls go to hell.” In it, we see Eilish dressing down until she’s in her bra while a voice-over delivers a ‘must-hear’ message. “Do you really know me? You have opinions about my opinions, about my music, about my clothes, about my body,” Eilish begins. “Some people hate what I wear, some people praise it. Some people use it to shame others, some people use it to shame me. But I feel you watching… always. And nothing I do goes unseen. So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sighs of relief, if I lived by them, I’d never be able to move.” “Would you like me to be smaller? Weaker? Softer? Taller? Would you like me to be quiet? Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest? Am I my stomach? My hips? The body I was born with, is it not what you wanted? If what I wear is comfortable, I am not a woman. If I shed the layers, I am a slut.” “Though you’ve never seen my body, you still judge it and judge me for it. Why? You make assumptions about people based on their size. We decide who they are. We decide what they’re worth. If I wear more, if I wear less, who decides what that makes me? What that means? Is my value based only on your perception? Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?” Watch the fan-shot video below. ﻿ As stated, Eilish performed a staggering 22-song set that included her recent James Bond theme “No Time To Die,” in addition to the hits from her body of work. Check out the full setlist below, as well as other fan-shot videos of the concert. “bury a friend”“you should see me in a crown”“my strange addiction”“ocean eyes”“COPYCAT”“WHEN I WAS OLDER”“8”“wish you were gay”“xanny”“The Hill” (Markéta Irglová cover)“lovely”“listen before i go”“i love you”“ilomilo”“bellyache”“idontwannabeyouanymore”“No Time to Die”“when the party’s over”“all the good girls go to hell”“everything i wanted”“bad guy”“goodbye” ﻿ ﻿ Eilish has a long way to go before the Where Do We Go Tour?

2282,https://www.si.com/soccer/2020/03/16/uswnt-protest-us-soccer-tshirt-crest-four-stars,"USWNT protest, invisible crest T-shirts become a record hit","Last week, an indelible protest by the U.S. women’s national team against the U.S. Soccer Federation turned into a viral business opportunity—and showed exactly how rabid the fan base for the USWNT really is. BreakingT is a company that makes moment-driven sports apparel, the kind that can jump on fan interest in real time to sell T-shirts and sweatshirts immediately after games. The company got the license for the USWNT Players Association ahead of World Cup 2019, and it had success selling shirts during the tournament like Rapinoe-Bird 2020, a nod to Megan Rapinoe and her partner, WNBA star Sue Bird. (BreakingT also has the license for the WNBA players union.) But what happened last week during the SheBelieves Cup put those World Cup sales figures to shame. It started with Christen Press’s bending golazo against England. BreakingT immediately put out a shirt bearing the likeness of Press and the call from ESPN broadcast Sebastian Salazar: “CHRISTEN PRESS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?” “That sold really, really well,” said BreakingT’s director of marketing, Dom Bonvissuto. “And it just continued to shine a light on the fact that women’s soccer and its fans are super-passionate and exactly the right fan base to hit with this model. Then on Wednesday night we saw that the women walked out with their warmups inside out. And we were obviously struck immediately by the empty shield with the four stars. That’s a shirty thing. We need to get going.” The USWNT’s protest was elegant in its simplicity. Two days earlier, new filings in the USWNT players’ gender-discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer had been released in which the federation argued that women’s players inherently had less skill, ability and responsibility than men’s players, which is why women were paid less than men. The legal strategy might have been useful in a court of law, but it was offensive and objectionable on a massive scale. Several U.S. Soccer sponsors—Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Deloitte, Volkswagen—issued strongly worded statements excoriating the federation. Meanwhile, the USWNT spoke with action. On game day, the players came up with a plan. Wearing their pregame warmups inside out made invisible the U.S. Soccer badge and left only the badge’s outline and the four stars above it, representing the team’s four World Cup victories. It was the perfect symbolism, a way to show the abject emptiness of the U.S. Soccer Federation while still honoring the players who have led the U.S. to its greatest soccer triumphs. The U.S. players only reinforced that point by having every single player on the team pose unsmiling in those shirts for the pregame photo that usually just includes the starting 11 players. BreakingT had a design for a T-shirt ready before the game even started and got it approved by Becca Roux, the executive director of the USWNTPA. Bonvissuto (full disclosure: He used to work as an SI.com editor) hit send on the first tweet announcing the sale of the “4 Stars Only” T-shirt (price: $28) at 10:17 p.m. ET on Wednesday, within minutes of the final whistle. “And it hit like crazy,” he said. Goosed along by tweets from Alex Morgan, Ashlyn Harris and Allie Long, the sales were remarkable. Even though the shirts were available for only one hour and 43 minutes on Wednesday, that day was the best-selling day for direct-to-consumer sales in BreakingT’s history. On Thursday came another record. “4 Stars Only” sold far more online than anything the company has ever produced, including all of the World Cup 2019 shirts and shirts commemorating the titles of the Washington Nationals and Kansas City Chiefs. When it came to “4 Stars Only,” Bonvissuto said, “We sold more than 5,000 units in the first 24 hours.” The USWNT players receive a portion of the proceeds, of course, but even on Wednesday night they anticipated what they might want to do with those. “We've already had conversations about where some of the proceeds from this could go, especially with the women's national team games being canceled in April,” Roux said. “Is there a way for us to funnel money to those independent-contractor employees who would have otherwise received work for those two games? That was something the players brought up on Wednesday night before we knew how successful it would be after the game.” One of the challenges of having a T-shirt company that has to work fast off breaking news is getting the various clearances to do so, including from the legal side of things. BreakingT did another shirt on Julie Ertz’s late game-winning goal against Spain (ERTZ SO GOOD). When it was pointed out on Twitter that the drawing of Ertz looked just like a shot taken by photographer Ashley Intile, the company ended up doing a royalty agreement with Intile. The success of the USWNT players’ own licensing ventures also shows that their ability to generate revenue goes far beyond what the federation has said and done with the team in the past. As Roux put it, “The players thought there was more in the market that wasn’t being monetized. There was value being left on the table, while at the same time the federation was using an argument of revenue generation against them.” “4 Stars Only” is just the latest evidence. It won’t be the last. Novak Djokovic plans to make his return for the U.S. Open on Aug. 30 in New York, where he will look to win his 21st career major and a calendar Grand Slam. After an investigation, the Rockies said there was no racial slur directed toward Lewis Brinson. But after watching the video several times, the Marlins outfielder disagrees. Plus, why the Saints trading Michael Thomas would be unsurprising, a Jared Goff anecdote from the Lions' first practice in front of fans and more. Senior expert Michael Fabiano is full steam ahead in providing his redraft fantasy football rankings for the 2021 NFL season. Josh Sargent is headed to the Premier League after securing a transfer away from his first pro club. The Braves' Brian Snitker waited 40 years to get his shot. There may never be anyone like him again—and that may be exactly why he’s had so much success. Luka Dončić is the first player to ever be eligible for a supermax rookie extension because he's already been selected first-team All-NBA twice.

2340,https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/councilwoman-faces-backlash-after-tweeting-solidarity-for-spreading-coronavirus-at-trump-rallies,Councilwoman faces backlash after tweeting 'solidarity' for spreading coronavirus at Trump rallies,"Candi CdeBaca, Denver City Councilwoman, shared a meme suggesting those infected with coronavirus should attend ""MAGA"" rallies. (Photo via www.denvergov.org) Democratic Denver City Councilwoman Candi CdeBaca faced conservative criticism Tuesday after sharing a meme on Twitter suggesting she stands in “solidarity” with the idea of spreading coronavirus at President Trump’s campaign rallies. ""These people are sick,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted. CdeBaca, apparently posting in jest, had retweeted a meme that said: “For the record, if I do get the coronavirus I’m attending every MAGA rally I can.” CdeBaca commented: “#solidarity Yaaaas!!” with laughing emojis. CdeBaca, based on her Twitter posts, appears to be a supporter of self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., one of the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans quickly hit back, coming amid a partisan war of words over allegations that lawmakers are politicizing the response to the coronavirus. “This elected Democrat in Colorado doesn’t seem very nice!” the Trump campaign War Room Twitter account posted in response. “The depths to which Democrats are sinking to politicize coronavirus is disgusting,"" Republican National Committee Rapid Response Director Steve Guest said in a statement to Fox News on Tuesday. ""Democrat leaders, both nationally and in Colorado, need to condemn this deranged comment.” Later, CdeBaca's office called it a ""sarcastic tweet,"" in a statement to a Denver ABC affiliate. The back and forth comes as the federal government grapples with the outbreak. Trump, over the weekend, authorized new travel restrictions and warnings in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The administration’s strict travel warning affects Iran, Italy and South Korea at this point. The virus has sickened 89,000 people across 66 countries, resulting in at least 3,061 deaths, including six in the U.S. Most of the deaths have occurred in mainland China. Trump, on Monday, was asked whether it was “safe” for him to continue to hold his campaign-style rallies as the country battles the virus. “You should ask the Democrats,” Trump said. “They’re all having rallies. They’re campaigning.” He added: “I think it’s very safe.” Advertisement READ MORE @ FOXNEWS.COM This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2021 FOX Television Stations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2362,https://flagandcross.com/joy-behar-says-trump-is-using-us-says-hes-only-holding-press-briefings-because-he-cant-hold-rallies/,Joy Behar Says Trump Is 'Using Us;' Says He's Only Holding Press Briefings Because He Can't Hold Rallies ⋆ Flag And Cross,"Published on By   Joy Behar, co-host of The View, recently claimed that the only reason President Trump is doing so many press briefings is because with all of the coronavirus craziness he is unable to hold political rallies. This, of course, is just further hate spewing forth from Behar who has made it more than clear over the last several years that she is not a big fan of President Trump and his administration. Here’s more from The Washington Examiner: Trending: Six City Council Members Hit with Recall Notice as Fed-Up Residents Take Matters Into Their Own Hands “He cannot have his ‘MAGA’ Trump rallies anymore, where they tell him how wonderful he is,” Behar said during Monday’s show. “He is using us instead of the MAGA rallies, and that’s why he makes these. He never made these when he was doing his rallies, and poor Dr. Fauci.” Behar, who is quarantining out of caution during the outbreak because her age puts her in a “higher-risk group” of contracting the virus, made the statements on The View from a remote location after co-host Sunny Hostin addressed Trump’s daily updates to the press. “It seems to me that networks should not even be at this point broadcasting his 90 minutes of misinformation,” Hostin said. “I understand why Cuomo’s on. That’s one thing, but I almost think it’s a disservice to the country at this point.” Behar later became rather gushy over Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying she’s “falling in love” with him. Apparently, according to her, he used to annoy her, but now she’s calling him “brilliant.” It seems that Behar is just looking for any excuse possible to trash on the president. A person has every right to disagree with someone and state those disagreements, but the kind of anger and hostility that Behar has for Trump is ridiculously out of proportion. China Syndrome US Supports UN’s Call For ‘Immediate Global Ceasefire’ Due To Coronavirus Pandemic NBC suffered its worst ratings disaster ever with the collapse of the woke 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Published on By  NBC suffered its worst ratings disaster ever with the collapse of the woke 2021 Tokyo Olympics. This year’s numbers came in worse than the 2016 ratings for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. According to the numbers, the games were an absolute disaster for NBC. It is so bad that the network has had to start giving extra ads to advertisers because the number of viewers have been far lower than the number that advertisers paid for. Per the Daily Wire: “When you look at the numbers, it’s hard to be pleased with them,” University of Alabama sports communications program director Andy Billings told the AP. “It’s probably NBC’s worst-case scenario, but it’s probably a worst-case scenario that they would have been able to predict months ago.” Fox News reported some of the Olympics’ disappointing numbers: “NBC’s primetime coverage of the Tokyo Olympics on July 26 averaged 14.7 million viewers — for a 49% drop compared to the equivalent night from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and 53% less than the 2012 London Olympics. The opening ceremonies saw their lowest viewership since 1988.” Americans’ excitement for the Olympics has flagged along with other sports, and some experts are blaming an increase on athlete activism for the lack of interest in sporting events. “Americans approached the Games with a collective shrug. Thirty-six percent of those polled in late July by Monmouth University in New Jersey said they had less interest in the Olympics than usual, and 3% had more interest,” the AP reported. Americans did not care at all about the woke Olympics were every other athlete supposedly competing in America’s name turned out to hate America! It is long past time that these arrogant athletes and their sports organizations get taken down a notch and get their comeuppance. Follow Warner… Two coaches at the U. of Oklahoma now say they have the right to take punitive action against students whose politics the coaches don’t like. Published on By  Two women’s volleyball coaches at the University of Oklahoma now say they have the right to take punitive action against students whose politics the coaches don’t like. Can you imagine? Now these hardcore leftist, anti-American “educators” are claiming that they can destroy a student simply because the kids practice wrong think outside the classroom. This is outrageous. The coaches’ claims come in connection to a lawsuit filed by player Kylee McLaughlin who sued coaches Lindsey and Kyle Walton along with the OU Board of Regents alleging that she had been excluded from the team “over her politically conservative views.” According to The College Fix, McLaughlin made political comments that the coaches didn’t like and at one point, one of the coaches said that Kyle Walton told her that he wouldn’t coach her any more. McLaughlin said in her lawsuit that the coaches “branded her as a racist and a homophobe” and her life became difficult at the school. The College Fix adds: According to the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, in their motion to dismiss the Waltons argue that even though they were the ones who injected politics into the team, they have the right to discipline those with differing views — in the name of “team unity.” “While Plaintiff was free to make bigoted statements, she was not free from the consequences of how her teammates perceived those statements,” the Waltons’ motion states. “The First Amendment cannot force her teammates to trust Plaintiff or desire to play with her. Consequently, the Complaint makes clear that Coach Walton was within her rights to cultivate a winning ‘team atmosphere by ensuring the players that ‘trust’ each other would be on the court.” In a nutshell: At a public university they can force players into volleyball-irrelevant political discussions … and to preserve… Welcome to the first stages of the informational oligarchy, folks.

2374,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/choa-chu-kang-riot-teenager-charged-with-possessing-two-knives-12498618,Choa Chu Kang riot: Teenager charged with possessing two knives and sickle,"Singapore Singapore Screengrabs of videos circulating on social media showing the riot. SINGAPORE: A teenager suspected to be linked to a riot in Choa Chu Kang last week was charged on Wednesday (Mar 4) with possessing dangerous weapons. Mohammad Helmi Parmadi, 17, is accused of possessing a watermelon knife, a bread knife and a sickle along the common corridor in front of Block 703 West Coast Road on Mar 2. Helmi was remanded for investigations and will return to court on Friday. If convicted, he faces a maximum jail term of three years and at least six strokes of the cane. He is suspected to be linked to a 13-man riot that took place at Block 102 Teck Whye Lane in broad daylight on Feb 27. Weapons including a knife, knuckle dusters, a metal bar and a metal rod that were believed to have been used in the fight were seized by the police. 13 MEN CHARGED The police said last week that they were alerted to a case of rioting at 10 Choa Chu Kang Way at about 1.30pm on Feb 27. The 13 men, aged between 17 and 28, were arrested in various locations including Jalan Bukit Merah, Yishun and Bukit Batok. They were charged on Feb 29 either with rioting with a deadly weapon or unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon. According to charge sheets, the riot was between two groups, with a group of eight men wanting to hurt the second group of five men and vice versa.

The Kentucky Wildcats got a huge win against the Florida Gators 71-70 in Gainesville Saturday afternoon in the last game of the regular season. The Cats came out how many expected they might: flat. And it was clear early on as they went into the half down 40-30. After the break, it got ugly. The officiating was horrific. Cal got ejected, or so he thought, then returned to the bench. And the team seemingly fell apart. Related They fought back the last 10 minutes, but it looked all for naught. But then something happened. The Cats exploded for a huge 18-point comeback win. The energy and effort they put forward could not be questioned as the game winded down. They fought to the very end. And it all paid off. What a win!!! Wait, what happened? We blacked out Apparently though, we came back to win from an 18-point second-half deficit on the road at Florida pic.twitter.com/suqJvuQcU5 As the regular season comes to an end, the postseason is in sight. Kentucky will play at 1 p.m. ET on Friday in Nashville. March Madness is officially here. Hagans did not make the trip After the turmoil that ensued during Kentucky’s second half collapse against the Tennessee Volunteers, there was rampant speculation and concern surrounding the team and Ashton Hagans. Well, that finally came to light this afternoon as John Calipari announced that Hagans did not even make the trip to Gainesville. Ashton did not make the trip with us to Florida. He and I met a couple days ago and he asked to step away for a couple days for personal reasons. I support his decision. We are going to need him at 100% for the postseason. While this isn’t ideal heading into postseason play, the Cats need Hagans to make a deep run in the coming weeks. It looks like he’s still being positive, though. Let’s Get this Win Fellas!!! Love y’all boyss Be back & Better!!! https://t.co/kRwLyDDzh0 Hopefully, this is just a blip on the radar and doesn’t affect UK in the long term. These kinds of things tend to either tear a team apart, or bring them all together. They didn’t respond well today, but we’ll see how they respond going forward. New starting five The last time I did this was because of Hagans and that’s the case again today. In the first matchup with the Gators, Hagans was coming off a thigh contusion and was questionable leading up to the game. He played—quite a bit actually—but Johnny Juzang earned his second start in his place. This time around, Keion Brooks was the one that earned the start. And Tyrese Maxey was running the point full-time for the first time in his short college career. The rest of the lineup remained the same, with the exception of Nate Sestina who started last game for the Senior Day festivities. The absence of Hagans meant UK was only able to play seven guys, but Calipari did mention that Dontaie Allen was available off the bench. Probably best not to burn his redshirt, though. The offense was stagnant, but recovered The offense was obviously stagnant without Hagans manning it. He makes mistakes and he’s frustrating, but his ability to penetrate the defense and attack was clearly missing today. UK just couldn’t get anything going. Florida changed up the defense time and time again and the Cats simply looked confused. They settled for jumpers and missed multiple point-blank shots. However, as the game went on, they fought back and it got much better. Enough to get a huge win on the road. Same with the defense Hagans’ absence was not only felt on the offensive end, but it was felt even more so on the defensive end. He is amazing at shutting players down, stealing passes, and disrupting the opposing team’s offense. That wasn’t there today and Kentucky looked bad at times. Whether it was losing their man or giving up easy drives, they just couldn’t stop the Gators. One thing that might’ve had something to do with this was the fact that UK basically had seven guys to play the entire game—assuming Cal didn’t want to burn Allen’s redshirt. That meant guys had to be careful not to foul and over-aggressiveness was probably discouraged. But in the final half of the game, the Cats continued to claw and scrape until they cleaned it up to shut down the Gators in the final 10 minutes, Sestina, Juzang, and Brooks gave some big-time minutes One positive was the play from the normal bench guys. Setina, Juzang, and Brooks all played very well today. They all have their flaws, especially defensively, but they gave Kentucky really, really GREAT minutes when they desperately needed it. All three of these guys played as hard as I’ve seen anyone play all season. They deserve the credit for keeping UK from getting blown out in this one. That’s big moving forward because the Cats will need it over the next few weeks. Bench play is huge and they will need to give the starters a breather when necessary. Despite the frustrations today, these guys took advantage of the opportunities they were given. I was ready to say, “Let’s just throw this one out and forget it happened, deal?” But this team regrouped and straightened this thing out. What a game and what a win by UK. Go Cats!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2435,https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/evolving-pokemon-hong-kong-women-063943284.html,"'Evolving like Pokemon', Hong Kong women step up to protest frontlines","By Pak Yiu HONG KONG (Reuters) - University student 'A', says she used to be a 'typical girl' who liked to shop, drink bubble tea and watch Korean soap operas but all that changed as Hong Kong's anti-government protests gained momentum and she stepped up to take a place in the frontlines. She is now charged with rioting, an offence which carries a maximum ten year jail sentence, and is on bail awaiting trial. The protests began last June and at first, the frontlines were predominantly men. That started to gradually change and women began building roadblocks, throwing back tear gas cannisters as well as facing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds. The 22-year-old, who did not want to be identified for fear it could affect her trial, said her shift to the frontline came in stages. ""I was at the back, I would just go home after I marched. I started to think I could go further and further forward, till I was at the very front."" At the frontlines, it can be hard to tell the difference between men and women among the black-clad protesters but 'A' says she felt a sense of female empowerment and gender equality when she came across other women - even if men sometimes tell women to retreat. In the past nine months, 7,165 people have been arrested, according to the city's Security Bureau. The protests have quietened down due to spread of the coronavirus, but there are signs the movement could again mobilise with at least three protests scheduled for Sunday. Although Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill, which sparked the protests, has been withdrawn, protesters have been marching for an investigation into police brutality and the downgrading of riot charges for those who have been arrested. The student says she believes more women could play a greater role in progressing the campaign for more democratic measures to be put in place across the city. ""Women should also come out for this. Men shouldn't be responsible for everything, women should also take some responsibility,"" she said. ""We're no longer weak, or the ones with 'princess syndrome'. So I think now, we are evolving like Pokemon, we're on another level. We're different.""

Canadian Pacific Railway on Tuesday upped its offer by $2 billion to $27.3 billion in cash and stock in a showdown with larger rival Canadian National Railway. That drove shares of Kansas City up 7% in early trading. Canadian Pacific shares fell, while Canadian National’s rose. It all started in March, when Canadian Pacific reached a $25 billion deal to acquire Kansas City in the hopes of creating the first railroad linking Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. One month later, Canadian National swooped in with a higher bid. It and Kansas City then agreed on a nearly $30 billion deal that’s set for a shareholder vote on August 19. Canadian Pacific’s move marks a U-turn, since the second-biggest Canadian railroad operator had vowed in April not to raise its bid. Still, its latest offer is lower than that of Canadian National. Canadian Pacific has said its rival’s offer would reduce competition and negatively impact shippers. Kansas City and Canadian National were not immediately available for comment.

2438,https://www.silive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/staten-island-amazon-worker-who-planned-protest-amid-coronavirus-is-fired.html,Staten Island Amazon worker who planned protest amid coronavirus is fired,"Staten Island Amazon workers walk out STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The worker who helped organize a walkout at Staten Island’s Amazon fulfillment center on Monday said later in the day that he was fired by the company. Workers at the Bloomfield-based fulfillment center walked out during their lunch break to protest working conditions during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. With city police officers making sure protestors maintained a six-foot distance from each other, at least 50 people took part in the rally in front of the facility, known as JFK8 -- which has 5,000 workers. The facility is Staten Island’s largest employer. The rally’s organizer, Chris Smalls, an employee at the facility, said he was fired today. “Amazon would rather fire workers than face up to its total failure to do what it should to keep us, our families, and our communities safe,"" said Smalls. ""I am outraged and disappointed, but I’m not shocked. As usual, Amazon would rather sweep a problem under the rug than act to keep workers and working communities safe. Today, I stood with my co-workers because conditions at JFK8 are legitimately dangerous for workers and the public. Amazon thinks this might shut me up, but I’m going to keep speaking up. My colleagues in New York and all around the country are going to keep speaking up. We won’t stop until Amazon provides real protections for our health and safety and clarity for everybody about what it is doing to keep people safe in the middle of the worst pandemic of our lifetimes,” he added. However, Amazon said in a statement to the Advance/SILive.com that Smalls was released of his duties because he violated social distancing guidelines. “Mr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines and putting the safety of others at risk. He was also found to have had close contact with a diagnosed associate with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and was asked to remain home with pay for 14 days, which is a measure we’re taking at sites around the world,"" said Amazon in a statement. “Despite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite today, March 30, further putting the teams at risk. This is unacceptable and we have terminated his employment as a result of these multiple safety issues,” she added. In response to the termination, Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said: “Workers should be protected when speaking out about safety conditions during this crisis. They are performing a public service. It is unacceptable that Amazon has terminated Chris Smalls for doing that today rather than addressing their serious COVID-19 safety problems.” While Amazon workers on Staten Island are not unionized, they have sought to form a union in the past. Some of the groups that sponsored the protest on Monday also issued a joint statement about Smalls being fired. “Amazon will give a lot of reasons for why Chris Smalls was fired today. But the facts stand: at midday today, Chris stood up and called out Amazon for failing to protect our safety and our health. Hours later, he was fired,"" said a joint statement from Athena Coalition director Dania Rajendra, Make the Road NY co-executive director Deborah Axt and New York Communities for Change director Jonathan Westin. “Chris, along with many of his colleagues in New York and around the country, have dared to tell the truth about the dangerous conditions at Amazon facilities. We can only conclude that instead of listening to the people who are actually risking their lives on the frontlines, Amazon would rather they just shut up about Amazon working conditions, which are now a national public health concern,” said the joint statement. MONDAY’S WALK OUT Amazon workers said they were protesting on Monday because the facility, known as JFK8, was not closed for deep cleaning after sources said that multiple workers had contracted the coronavirus. While it appeared there were at least 50 protesters at the walk out, Amazon said only about 15 of them were employed at the facility. A spokesperson for the Amazon facility wouldn’t confirm the number of coronavirus cases and told the Advance on Saturday that the facility would not be closed for deep cleaning. Amazon said the confirmed cases at JFK8 are not linked to one another. And the workers who contracted the virus had no contact with each other, the company said. “Workers are really scared right now. As of this morning, it looks like there is another case in the warehouse. This brings it up to six or seven cases,” said Zack Lerner, the organizing director of New York Communities for Change, which helped stage the walkout with Made The Road New York. Both are grassroots organizations. Lerner claimed management didn’t make employees aware of the confirmed cases. *** CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF CORONAVIRUS IN NEW YORK *** RELATED COVERAGE Amazon workers protest working conditions amid coronavirus outbreak Amazon workers plan walkout at Staten Island facility Monday due to coronavirus S.I.

Authorities in West Valley, Utah say 27-year olds Yuri Silva and Christian Hernandez were pulled over on their way to a protest in Salt Lake City, and cops found several firearms in their vehicle, including what the Deseret News describes as an Uzi with a suppressor. In the home of Yuri Neves Silva, 27, of West Valley City, more weapons were found and seized. Information about a potential motive was not immediately available, but police believe the two were headed to the protests to cause trouble. “We had every reason to believe that’s what they intended to do,” Vainuku said. Silva had posted “multiple threats of violence against police, specifically Salt Lake City police and West Valley City police” over social media and “encouraged others to take up arms against police as well, and had reportedly listed the names and addresses of specific officers to be targeted,” she said. Silva was arrested for investigation of making a terroristic threat. Police say Silva was making multiple posts about harming police officers and was seen in one picture holding a gun, according to a police affidavit. Silva’s not a prohibited person, but the same can’t be said for his buddy. Christian Hernandez is now facing felon in possession and drug charges after marijuana was found in the vehicle along with the firearms. As for Silva’s alleged threats, they seem to be pretty specific in their intent. “In one video posted on (Sunday), the suspect made a video showing himself mocking the Salt Lake City curfew, stating, ‘Hands up don’t shoot,’” while also threatening to kill police officers, the affidavit states. “The suspect also made comments knowing officers were trying to follow his Facebook page and he directed officers to stay at home to protect their families, otherwise ‘we will have no choice but to affiliate you with your … colleagues and their actions.’ “The suspect also mentions a police officer who resides in his neighborhood and comments, ‘You put that cop car in the garage real quick play boi,’” according to the affidavit. According to police, Silva denies that he had any actual intent to harm police officers, but admitted that he hoped his social media posts would incite others to violence. That excuse may have been more believable if Silva and Hernandez hadn’t had multiple firearms with them on their way to what was supposed to be a peaceful protest. Thankfully, things seem to be calming down in Salt Lake City after a weekend of violence. Protests on Tuesday were loud but lawful for the most part. One person was arrested at the state capitol after protests continued long past the curfew imposed by the mayor, but that was it. If Silva and Hernandez hadn’t been apprehended, however, who knows how bad things would have gotten. The legitimate protesters may have issues with police, but they should be praising officers for their actions in thwarting what very well could have turned a peaceful protest into a bloodbath.

2597,https://activistmommy.com/extinction-rebellion-protests-climate-abuse-with-topless-human-chain-on-international-womens-day/,"Extinction Rebellion Protests ""Climate Abuse"" With Topless Human Chain On International Women's Day ⋆ Elizabeth Johnston","Extinction Rebellion has done it again. It seems there’s no deed to embarrassing or asinine for this particular brand of climate hysteric to commit in their deluded plot to save humanity from global warming. While you might know them for gluing themselves to planes, trains, buildings, roads, and the gates of Downing Street, 31 female members of the group opted for a protest befitting the International Women’s Day on which it occurred: a topless human chain. Because what could possibly spread awareness and call world leaders to action better than a bunch of women standing around half-naked in the middle of a winter day in London? According to the Metro, the women stood on Waterloo Bridge with “climate rape” and “climate murder” and other slogans painted on their bare chests. Sarah Mintram, a former teacher and participant in the protest explained that the rationale behind the topless protest is the dubious fact that women are suffering more than men due to violence caused by climate change. Yeah. Really. “It’s mainly women in poorer countries in the global south that are experiencing the increase in violence but this will be the reality for all women if the climate and ecological crisis continues to go unaddressed,” Mintram said. “We are here to raise the alarm about what is happening to our sisters around the world and to tell women in the UK the climate and ecological emergency is your issue,” she continued, “It will affect you as a woman if we do not persuade our government to take urgent action starting now.” “As part of a series of actions around the world, XR UK women formed a topless chain across Waterloo Bridge to highlight the vulnerability of women in the face of climate breakdown,” the group said in a tweet sharing the photos.  “The climate emergency is a women’s emergency,” the group continued. “We are here to highlight the increase in hardship, violence & rape already facing women in the global south as a result of the climate & ecological emergency.”  “Why is climate a women’s issue? A January 2020 report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that climate breakdown and environmental degradation are driving an increase in violence against women,” Extinction Rebellion said in a tweet explaining the protest. They cited a January 2020 report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which claimed that climate change was responsible for violence against women in the Southern Hemisphere. “The report found that deforestation and the degradation of land mean women have to travel further to collect the things they need, like firewood, and are exposed to violence, rape and abduction when they make these journeys,” the group continued. According to Breitbart, Extinction Rebellion has been plaguing London’s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) for years. Their antics cost the capitol’s police force—and therefore taxpayers—an estimated £37 million last year alone, more than double the £15 million annual budget for the Violent Crime Taskforce. I cannot wait for the next few decades to go by only for these folks to realize that they’ve fallen for a complete and utter hoax. Well, those who survive any future attempts to glue themselves to public transportation vehicles, anyway.

Sen. Bernie Sanders. | Scott Olson/Getty Images By VICTORIA GUIDA 03/08/2020 10:26 AM EDT Link Copied Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday acknowledged that he and his presidential opponents are in an age group that is more vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak but said he wouldn’t limit his activities. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” whether he, former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump should limit travel and avoid crowds, as has been recommended for older Americans, Sanders replied: “In the best of all possible worlds, maybe. But right now, we're running as hard as we can.” He cited his three rallies on Saturday and said he’s holding two more Sunday. “I’ve been working really, really hard,” he said. “Look, this is the most consequential election in the modern history of the United States of America. Trump, in my view, is a president who is a liar, who is running a corrupt administration, who does not understand the Constitution of the United States, who thinks he's above the law. He has to be beaten.” Sanders is 78, Biden is 77 and Trump 73. POLITICO NEWSLETTERS Unpacking the national conventions and the race for the White House.

The Vermont senator’s aides in recent days have emphasized the length and frequency of his campaign events compared to Biden's, but Sanders batted away a question about whether his Democratic opponent is unable to handle the rigors of the campaign. “No, no,” he said. “What we’re talking about is my schedule. … Joe Biden is a friend of mine, and Joe and I have disagreements on the issues. I do not make personal attacks on Joe.” Link Copied © 2021 POLITICO LLC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Image supplied The town of Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) continues to burn, with attacks on trucks during the week followed up with the setting alight of six out of seven cars at the town’s Social Development offices. Protestors in Ladysmith KZN. Government vehicles set on fire. pic.twitter.com/fy69KbkHrJ Protests have been ongoing in Ladysmith since February, with incensed residents calling for the head of fraud and corruption accused Alfred Duma local municipality mayor Vincent Madlala, as well as bemoaning poor service delivery, water shortages and escalating violence between warring taxi associations. The Department of Social Development vehicles were torched on Wednesday evening, and although there is currently no leads on who the culprits are, eNCA report that evidence points to a petrol bomb attack. Roads going in and out of town have been barricaded with the carcasses of burnt-out trucks and minibus taxis that continue to enforce a total shutdown in the area. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala decried the loss of nearly R2 million a day with businesses, factories and transport operators rendered utterly unable to function amid the chaos. KZN MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for the perpetrators of the attack on the government vehicles to be swiftly brought to justice. “The department has received a report and seen pictures with its six vehicles burnt by brazen criminals,” said Khoza. “We are shocked at this despicable act of vandalism, which is totally abhorrent, destructive and beyond any justification whatsoever.” “These vehicles are an important tool used to quickly respond and provide services to our needy communities,” she said. She said that the crime was just another in a long line of threatening acts committed against government employees in the area. “The torching of our vehicles is another form of threatening employees who have suffered a lot of hijackings in the past.” “The law must take its course wherever and whenever our properties are under threat. We urge police to investigate such criminal activities without fear or favour. No-one should do these despicable and morally reprehensible acts, despite any frustration,” she said. Police are investigating the matter. Do you have a news story for The South African?

The Israeli TV Channel 13 quoted a high-ranking official in the Israeli foreign ministry as saying that the Israeli interim Ambassador to Russia, Eli Belotserkovsky, has visited the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and registered Tel Aviv's protest over the movement's visit. The Israeli diplomat is said to have told Bogdanov that the ""Islamic Jihad is a terrorist organisation, backed by Iran that does not recognise Israel's right to exist and systematically undermines arrangements in the Gaza Strip by attacking Israeli civilians."" READ: Victories continue to mount against pro-Israel defamation campaign In a statement, Islamic Jihad announced that a senior delegation headed by the movement's Secretary General, Ziad Al-Nakhalah, arrived on Wednesday in Moscow and met with Russian officials including Foreign Minister Lavrov. The movement added that the delegation also included Muhammad Al-Hindi, Abdel Aziz Al-Minnawi and the movement's representative in Lebanon, Ihsan Ataya, adding that the visit came ""in response to an official invitation extended by the Russian foreign ministry"".

2907,https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/04/27/anti-caa-protests-were-funded-from-middle-east-delhi-police.html,Anti-CAA protests were funded from Middle East: Delhi police,"Police granted custody of Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia Alumni president The protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act held at Jamia Millia Islamia University and other parts of Delhi were funded from the Middle East, the Delhi Police told a local court on Monday. The Patiala House Courts later sent Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia alumni president who was arrested on Sunday, to 10-day police custody. “From the interrogation of witnesses, it is revealed that accused Shifa Ur Rehman received funds from members of alumni association of Jamia Millia Islamia based in Middle East countries and he was co-coordinating at the protest sites,"" the Delhi police said in its application demanding custody of Rahman. Police said Rahman's name had popped up during the questioning of Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Meeran Haider, Safora Zargar, Gulfisa, Tahir Hussain, and three members of the Popular Front of India (PFI). ""Shifa-Ul-Rehman is also found actively involved in a conspiracy hatched in setting up anti CAA/NPR/NRC protests at various sites in Delhi, giving hate speeches that led to the riots in February 2020 at various protest sites, i.e., Jamia Nagar, Shaheen Bagh, Seelampur, Khureji, Inderlok and Hauz Rani,"" it said. According to police, Rehman along with AAJMI members namely Areeb and Badre Alam and other members of Jamia Co-ordination Committee (JCC), had visited various protest sites in Delhi. The Delhi police told the court that during the investigation, names of some more suspects have come out and the accused should be questioned at length about those suspects to obtain their exact particulars. “Huge money was also funded as well as spent by the conspirators to carry out these riots in Delhi,"" the police said, adding that the custodial interrogation of Rahman is required to confront him with huge technical data and other evidence collected during investigation. At least 53 people died in Delhi in February as those opposing and favouring the new citizenship law clashed each other, leaving a trail of destruction in several areas of the national capital. The Special Cell of the Delhi Police is probing the larger conspiracy behind the riots. Copyright © 2021 All rights reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2933,https://globalnews.ca/news/6841208/coronavirus-nurses-block-protest-denver/,‘Go to China!’: ‘Nurses’ hailed for blocking anti-quarantine ‘Karen’ at coronavirus protest,"Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. Health-care workers are the only people standing between everyday citizens and the novel coronavirus — even if those everyday citizens value their own personal freedom over things like public health, common sense or their own lives. That dynamic was on full display in Denver, Colo., over the weekend, where the United States got its own bizarre Tiananmen Square-like photo moment — except instead of a protester standing up to a government tank, it was two health-care workers standing up to a “Land of the free”-loving couple in a truck. Video and photos circulating online show two people in scrubs and masks blocking a crosswalk to stop a procession of far-right protesters en route to the state’s Capitol, where many of their ilk were already violating physical distancing rules to call for an end to the coronavirus lockdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus. Remarkable scene at 12th and Grant, where two healthcare workers from a Denver-area hospital — they declined to say which or give their names — are standing in the crosswalk during red lights as a “reminder,” they say, of why shutdown measures are in place. pic.twitter.com/7xTjXvGN2E — Chase Woodruff (@dcwoodruff) April 19, 2020  The two counter-protesters — a man and a woman — could be seen standing in the path of a large silver pickup truck on Sunday, refusing to budge while the vehicle’s occupants hurled a flurry of verbal abuse at them. A witness described them as “nurses” in his video, although their exact professions are unknown. They told another witness they were health-care workers. READ MORE: Store boss flips off coronavirus hoarder asking for $10K toilet paper refund “Go to China!” a middle-aged blonde woman in a U.S.A. shirt shouted at them from the pickup truck, while leaning out of the passenger’s window. “It’s a free country! America the free!” she declared, before slapping a sign reading “Land of the free” onto the windshield. The two health-care workers did not move. Videos and photos of the incident have circulated widely on the internet, where many have called it a perfect encapsulation of the anxiety and frustration emerging around the COVID-19 pandemic. The illness has killed more than 40,000 people in the United States alone, while lockdowns meant to slow its spread have tipped the world into a major recession. Many have become impatient with the lockdowns, although grouping up to protest those lockdowns appears to be a largely right-wing phenomenon at this point. READ MORE: COVIDIOTS — New name for shaming ignorant, selfish coronavirus reactions More than 12 million people have watched the Denver video on Twitter alone, where the angry woman has been dubbed “Karen” — an internet slang term for an irritating woman who demands to speak to the manager when she doesn’t get her way. “The most un-American thing you can do is tell medical professionals who’re saving American lives to go to China,” Twitter user Michelle Sylvester wrote. “Bye Karen.” I cannot wait for this to become an iconic photo. Sucks to suck, Karen. pic.twitter.com/XG36OIDoA4 — Andrea (@AndreaCollins76) April 20, 2020  “Here we see a racist Karen in her non-native habitat telling an Asian American nurse to ‘go to China,’” wrote Dr. Eugene Gu on Twitter. “Such fascinating yet peculiar behavior, since Karen may soon find herself in need of the nurse’s lifesaving care in the coming months.” Another user described the woman as “COVID Karen,” adding: “This is America in one photo.” READ MORE: ‘Give me liberty or … COVID-19’: The irony of coronavirus protests in the U.S. The Colorado protest was one of more than a dozen across the United States over the weekend, where many conservative voices — including U.S. President Donald Trump — have urged Americans to defy scientist-recommended measures meant to keep everyone safe from the virus. Trump appeared to turn the lockdown into another front in the U.S. culture war on Friday when he encouraged Americans to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia — three states with Democratic governors running their lockdowns. READ MORE: Trump vs. himself — How he dismissed the coronavirus, in his own words Pro-Trump signs have been a common sight at these protests, including the one in Denver. “These people love our country,” Trump said at his daily press briefing in Washington on Sunday, when asked about the right-wing protests. “They want to get back to work.” — Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know: Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate. Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities. To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

2945,https://www.indy100.com/news/coronavirus-fox-news-protest-social-distancing-9468216,Coronavirus: Fox News hosts keep telling people to go and protest 'for their freedom' instead of social distancing,"As social distancing and lockdown measures are extended in many countries, people are starting to get frustrated. In some instances – instead of staying inside, or writing to their representatives – people are starting to defy lockdown and hold physical protests. Fox News hosts are among those encouraging people to carry out physical protests against stay-at-home orders, potentially endangering the lives of countless others. In Michigan, a mass protest was organised in defiance of the governor’s stay-at-home orders. Recent figures put the number of deaths in Michigan at 1,900. Laura Ingraham, a prominent host on FOX news, tweeted in approval and suggested that the same may start to happen in other states. Initially, protesters were supposed to create traffic gridlock and hold signs from their cars, but a group gathered on the steps of Michigan’s city hall. They said that the damage caused by the economic impact of stay-at-home orders was greater than the damage caused by Covid-19. Other Fox News hosts, such as Jeanine Pirro, expressed similar sentiments on TV, saying that health officials had ""overblown sentiments"" and that the American spirit would not ‘take it’. She also said that what had happened in Lansing, Michigan, would start to happen all over the country. On the Fox news website, coverage of protests featured prominently. Ingraham, Pirro and a number of other Fox News hosts were calling for stricter lockdown measures and more guidance from central government towards the end of March, although they appear to have changed their mind after a few weeks. There’s little evidence to suggest that any states in the US have reached a peak in Covid-19 cases. Other prominent personalities in right-wing media have expressed frustration at public health measures – pro-Trump commentator Candace Owens tweeted in anger after being asked to wear a mask in a supermarket (she also said that she had been going every day). Similar protests have taken place in Vancouver, Canada, where a small group of people gathered to protest what they saw as government overreach, and were promptly fined or arrested.

The new survey, published Monday and conducted by the Detroit Regional Chamber, found that 57 percent of respondents approved of Whitmer's coronavirus response in Michigan, while just 37 percent disapproved.

Among those surveyed, 39 percent self-identified as Democrats, while 35 percent identified as Republicans and 26 percent said they were independents. In total, 600 Michigan residents were polled. Last Wednesday, thousands of protesters descended on Lansing to demonstrate against the social-distancing requirements put in place by Michigan's Democratic governor. While organizers encouraged demonstrators to remain in their cars as they drove through the city holding signs and waving flags, some protesters exited their vehicles and disregarded social distancing measures. Demonstrators held signs that read: ""Security Without Liberty Is Called Prison,"" ""Liberty Once Lost Is Lost Forever"" and ""Recall Whitmer,"" USA Today reported. Trump later voiced his support for the anti-social-distancing protests in Michigan as well as in other states around the country. ""Liberate Michigan!"" the president tweeted on Friday. ""A small segment of the state is protesting, and that's their right,"" Whitmer told CNN on Wednesday. ""The sad part is, though, that the more that they're out and about, the more likely they are to spread COVID-19 and the more likely we're going to have to take this posture for a longer period of time,"" she warned. As of early Monday afternoon, Michigan had more than 30,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Of those, 2,374 people have died. Tori Meyer, a resident of Berrien County in southwest Michigan, told Newsweek that she supported Whitmer's stay-at-home order and believed the governor was taking appropriate steps to protect the people of her state. ""Hands down, I trust Whitmer more than Trump,"" Meyer, 30, said. ""Instead of leading us, he's gone back and forth with his stance on the coronavirus, refuses to fully address the issues and instead let the states fight it out with each other, so to speak."" Meyer said she wasn't surprised that people had protested the lockdown but felt embarrassed by the demonstrations. ""It's embarrassing for others to see that and think maybe all Michiganders are that way,"" Meyer said. ""No one wants to be stuck at home right now, but I look at this as my civic duty. Is it inconvenient and kind of boring? Yes. But the more we are all in this together and staying home, the faster this will be over."" She also said she was ""infuriated"" by Trump's tweet about Michigan. ""He's fanning the flames and blatantly inciting violence in our state, which is the last thing we need right now,"" Meyer told Newsweek. Several governors have criticized Trump for supporting the demonstrations against social-distancing measures. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, who faced a similar protest in Annapolis on Saturday, told CNN on Sunday that the demonstrators were essentially protesting against guidelines laid out by the White House. ""So then to encourage people to go protest, the plan that you just made recommendations on on Thursday, it just doesn't make any sense,"" Hogan said. ""We're sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations."" National polling has shown that the majority of Americans support stay-at-home orders, with most respondents more concerned that the government will move too quickly to reopen the economy than too slowly. A survey released Sunday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed that 58 percent of respondents were concerned that the U.S. would ease stay-at-home guidance too quickly, while only 32 percent said they were concerned the economy wouldn't be reopened quickly enough. A similar poll released last week by Pew Research Center found that 66 percent were concerned that state governments would be too quick to ease their coronavirus restrictions.

In tandem with Donald Trump, Fox News hosts and other influential conservatives spent the weekend egging on a small number of mask-less protesters flouting social distancing guidelines by crowding state capitols and demanding that closure orders be lifted. These “Give me liberty and give me death!” rallies, as a Washington Post satire piece put it, represent the opinions of a decided minority: A Politico–Morning Consult poll released last week found that 81% of Americans support maintaining social distancing measures “for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy,” while nearly 60% of respondents in a similar NBC–Wall Street Journal survey voiced concerns over the U.S. lifting mitigation efforts too soon. But perhaps out of wishful thinking, members of the right-wing media are nonetheless framing protests as the Tea Party movement reincarnated. “A lot of people are very proud of you,” said Fox News host Jeanine Pirro during a Saturday night interview with Meshawn Maddock, an organizer behind the so-called “Operation Gridlock” protest in Lansing, Michigan. “Peaceful protests, civil liberties, it’s what we’re all about. Keep going.” The segment aired after Pirro’s colleagues had spent days praising the protests. Last week Tucker Carlson hosted Maddock and thanked the Michigan Conservative Coalition activist for her service. On Saturday morning Fox & Friends prominently displayed the locations of future rallies on a map of the country—exactly what the network did years prior to promote the anti-Obama Tea Party protests. An article published on Fox’s website took the effort a step further, embedding a tweet with contact information for those who wished to join the Wisconsin Freedom Rally. On Friday conservative talk radio giant Rush Limbaugh cheered on the protesters by citing historic examples of American bravery and sacrifice, including U.S. involvement “in World War II,” adding, “This shutdown, and hunkering down in total fear, is not a hallmark of American history.” Moving in lockstep with his media allies, the president has personally incited the protests, writing in three separate tweets on Friday, “LIBERATE MINNESOTA,” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN,” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA...save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!” Speaking at the White House’s coronavirus task force briefing on Sunday, Trump doubled down, calling the protesters “a very orderly group of people,” despite the fact that some flew Confederate flags and flashed signs with swastikas, and falsely claiming that protesters “were all six feet apart,” despite an abundance of photo and video evidence to the contrary. “Their life was taken away from them. They want their life back,” he concluded. Responding to a question on the protesters’ use of Nazi symbolism, the president delivered a remark reminiscent of his infamous “very fine people on both sides” line following a 2017 white nationalist rally: “Well that, I totally would say, no way. But I didn’t see that.” Trump’s outspoken support marks the latest flashpoint in the White House’s ongoing war with states amid the pandemic. A number of governors aired their opposition to Trump’s comments throughout Sunday, including Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who asserted that now is “not the time for protests, this is not the time for divisiveness”; and Washington governor Jay Inslee, who condemned Trump’s fostering of “illegal activity” and said, “It is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.” Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, the right’s primary target in their justification of the rallies, did not directly address them, but she did explain why some in Michigan are failing to grok the reasoning behind social distancing policies. “The hard part of public health is when you’re doing a good job, you’re saving lives, and it’s hard to quantify precisely what that looks like,” she told CNN. And Maryland governor Larry Hogan noted that it is not “helpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the president’s own policy.… You can’t start to reopen under his plan until you have declining numbers for 14 days, which those states and my state do not have.” Hogan’s deputy communications director also noted that Monday’s Reopen Maryland–organized rally in Annapolis saw “more media inquiries” than actual protesters. Indeed, the gatherings have typically featured attendees in the dozens or low triple figures, making Michigan’s Thursday crowd of roughly 3,000 an outlier. Though the likes of Fox have framed the protests as an organic grassroots push, a good number have been organized through a network of Facebook pages that appear to have been launched by a right-wing activist family known for using pro-gun and anti-abortion social media posts to harvest data, per reports from the Washington Post and NBC News. Aaron, Ben, Chris, and Matthew Dorr are reportedly behind pages that have accumulated more than 200,000 members in total, such as New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine and Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine. However, given Facebook’s newly announced ban on groups advocating for social distancing violations, it’s unclear how much longer these groups will be allowed to exist on the platform. The family declined requests for comment from NBC News and the Post, but Ben Dorr called accusations of them running a scam operation “fake news” in a response to the Philadelphia Inquirer. In one of the Dorrs’ most successful pushes, over 100,000 Facebook users have joined a Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantines group, and at least 300 of those members RSVP’d for an “Operation Gridlock” protest next week. (The group’s creator, Ben Dorr, lives in Iowa, NBC News found.) The scheduled rally is a rip-off of Michigan’s “Operation Gridlock,” which was staged by a group backed by the billionaire family of Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Trump blamed the governors for instigating the backlash, casting their shutdown policies as extreme, even though many are in accordance with recommendations from the White House’s own Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “If people feel that way, you’re allowed to protest. Some governors have gone too far, some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate,” he told reporters on Sunday. When Chuck Todd pressed Mike Pence about Trump’s protest cheerleading—“Why is the president trying to undermine the guidance you’ve been laying out?”—Pence deflected. “I don’t accept your premise,” he said, “and I don’t think most Americans do either.” — Does the King of the Coronavirus Contrarians Have a Case?— In the COVID-19 Crisis, Warren Buffett Is Lying Low—And Bill Ackman Stepping Up— Can You Beat COVID-19 Without a Lockdown?

The large group gathered outside the Harris County Administration Building in downtown Houston Wednesday. The protest, similar to others taking place across the country, highlighted the growing tension between personal liberty and public health in a time of national crisis. About 200 people carrying signs, flags and bull horns gathered on the sidewalk. “I’m tired of the government trying to tell us what to do,"" said protestor Marga Matthews. The protest was organized by longtime conservative activist Dr. Steven Hotze and attorney Jared Woodfill, the former chairman of the Harris County Republican Party. They also filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to block the order requiring all county residents to wear face masks, to wash their hands, and to not touch their faces for 30 days on pain of a one thousand dollars fine. Their lawsuit contends Judge Hidalgo’s order is unconstitutional and an overreach of her power. “The order that we’re dealing with right now we believe is an unconstitutional, trampling and infringement on our liberties,” Woodfill said. “This is one individual who is dictating from her office over there on Preston as to what we can or can’t do.” In opposition, the county attorney says the Texas Constitution gives the judge broad power during an emergency to implement public health measures such as quarantine and the wearing of face masks. “There’s no constitutional right not to wash your hands; no constitutional right during a pandemic to be allowed to spread a deadly virus to other people,"" Assistant Harris County Attorney Seth Hopkins said. “It’s reasonable, during this transition phase, to ask people to cover their mouths. Similar laws were declared constitutional during the 1918 pandemic. They were constitutional then, they’re constitutional today.” The judge’s order follows recommendations from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already being followed in Dallas and Bexar counties. Other Texas counties, like Galveston and Montgomery counties are opposing the measure on constitutional grounds. But medical experts like Dr. Joseph Varon who treat virus victims at the United Memorial Medical Center in north Houston say requiring face masks makes sense. “Some of my own friends are not happy with this idea.” Dr. Varon said. “This is a measure that may prevent more spreading of the COVID. As it is right now, we’re still in a crisis, we’re still not over this hump. And this will prevent more cases."" Copyright 2020 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.

3256,https://www.q13fox.com/news/washington-anglers-protest-coronavirus-fishing-closure,Washington anglers protest coronavirus fishing closure,"Protest planned Sunday in Olympia, Washington RICHLAND, Wash. -- Protesters in boats and on shore Saturday demanded that restrictions on recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting in Washington because of the coronavirus be lifted.About 50 boats along with several hundred protesters on shore gathered on Saturday around Columbia Point Marina in Richland in southeastern Washington. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife on March 25 temporarily closed recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.But the protesters say the restrictions should be lifted because anglers can practice social distancing while fishing. They said kayakers, jet skis, wake boarders, pleasure boaters and others are on the water.“There’s nobody but us two out in the middle of the river,” Alan Doughty told the Tri-City Herald. He was on their boat in the Columbia River with Pam Doughty and their two dogs. ""We’ve got a $60,000 boat. We have I don’t know how much in gear. We’ve got a fishing license. We’ve got insurance, and we can’t use it,”Ben Hanes organized the protest after noticing non-fishing boaters on the water and believed the restrictions on fishing were unfair.“The anglers of Washington state aren’t going to put up with (the ban) much longer,” he said.Al Bernicker, 74, regularly comes to Columbia Point to fish. This time he brought a sign that said, “I can sit here. Why not fish here. I am 6-feet apart.” Advertisement Washington has at least 11,735 virus cases and 611 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally on Saturday afternoon.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with pre-existing health problems.

Angry demonstrators took to the streets in North Carolina and Missouri on Tuesday to voice their discontent at their states’ stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. The protests in Raleigh, N.C. and Jefferson City, Mo., are the latest in a series of protests across the country against state lockdown orders – fueled by tweets of support from President Trump and the economic unease caused by the coronavirus. Holding handmade signs with slogans like “My Rights Are Essential” and “ReOpenNC,” hundreds of people marched through downtown Raleigh while chanting “Freedom Now.” Most of the people at the protest were not wearing masks and were ignoring orders to maintain social distancing practices. Similar signs along with a slew of American flags were seen as people began to gather outside the Missouri Capitol building, although the protestors seemed to be trying to maintain better social distancing than in North Carolina. Protests against the lockdown orders have cropped up in numerous states over the past few weeks as some Americans have become frustrated with being told to stay at home and with the economic freefall the virus has caused. The federal government said Thursday that 5.2 million more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the four-week total to about 22 million out of a work force of 159 million — easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record. The losses translate to about one in seven workers. Last week, hundreds of cars, trucks and SUVs descended on Michigan’s state capital Wednesday afternoon as part of a noisy protest against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s social-distancing restrictions that critics say have gone too far. The same day, a number of people gathered outside the Kentucky Capitol building to protest Gov. Andy Beshear’s shutdown orders, while more gathered in Virginia to protest on Thursday. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Several hundred people rallied in Texas' capital over the weekend, chanting “Let us work!” Many clamored for an immediate lifting of restrictions in a state where more than 1 million have filed for unemployment since the crisis began. The rally was organized by a host of Infowars, owned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who joined protesters on the Capitol steps. Jones is being sued in Austin over using his show to promote falsehoods that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut was a hoax. In Indianapolis, more than 200 people stood close together outside the governor's mansion, carrying American flags and signs demanding that Gov. Holcomb lift restrictions. Indiana's state health department reported 529 new cases between April 7 and midday Friday, raising the total to more than 10,600. The number of deaths rose by 26, to 545. Elsewhere, a few hundred demonstrators waved signs outside the Statehouse in New Hampshire, which has had nearly 1,300 cases of the virus and more than three dozen deaths. More protests this week are planned in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin. TRUMP ‘FOMENTING DOMESTIC REBELLION,’ DEM GOVERNOR INSLEE SAYS While many governors have pleaded with their constituents to not protest during the public health crisis as it may only cause more people to get sick, the demonstrations – mainly organized by conservative groups – have found an ally in the president. “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA,” Trump said in a tweet-storm in over the weekend in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticizing the federal response. Four states – Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas – already have lifted some restrictions or plan to this week. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, gave the green light for some outdoor areas in the state to reopen late last week even as he cautioned that social distancing guidelines should remain in place. Florida has been one of the state’s hardest hit by the contagion, with almost 26,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 764 deaths. The state was one of the last in the nation to order a lockdown and was heavily criticized for leaving beaches open during part of the spring break period last month. But by late Friday afternoon, thousands of people flooded the beaches in places like Jacksonville after they reopened despite pleas from mayors to practice safe social distancing measures. In nearby South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is set to announce on Monday the reopening of state beaches and some retail stores. McMaster already reinstated last Friday access to public boat ramps and landings. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced over the weekend that state parks will reopen for recreational activity on Monday, so long as citizens wear masks and maintain a distance of six feet from each other. Subsequent measures will allow hospitals to resume elective tests and surgeries while stores can start “retail to go” services, starting on Wednesday and Friday, respectively. Despite the protests and opening up of some states, many lawmakers and public health officials warn that the country is far from safe when it comes to dealing with the virus. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has recorded more than 788,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that over 39,000 people in the country have died for the disease. Public Health officials have said the ability to test enough people and trace contacts of the infected is crucial before easing restrictions, and that infections could surge anew unless people continue to take precautions.

3542,https://www.yahoo.com/huffpost/extremists-anti-shutdown-protests-161305527.html,The Extremists And Grifters Behind Many Of The Anti-Lockdown Protests,"Many of the right-wing protests against state stay-at-home orders sweeping the nation have been organized or attended by white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, anti-government militias, members of a neo-fascist street gang, and other assorted extremists and scam artists, a HuffPost analysis shows. The protests, largely coordinated on Facebook, have seen crowds of hundreds descend upon state and city government buildings, where participants flagrantly flout social distancing guidelines to demand that their respective governors reopen state businesses during a deadly pandemic. Images of these often heavily armed protesters, screaming at health care workers and blocking ambulances from reaching hospitals, have gone viral, shocking a country where polls show a large majority support measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has already killed over 45,000 people in this country. Yet the events — which present a clear danger to communities across the U.S., risking the further spread of a virus — have been promoted extensively by Fox News. On Friday, immediately after a Fox segment sympathetic to the rallies, the president tweeted out his support for the protesters. “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA,” Trump wrote in a tweet-storm, directly contradicting the advice of the medical experts on his own COVID-19 task force. It’s easy to see why footage of the protests might excite the president. They bear a striking resemblance, after all, to his own fascist campaign rallies, with attendees who are almost uniformly white, and who display a deep devotion to the president, donning red MAGA hats and waving Trump 2020 flags. And like Trump’s rallies, the anti-shutdown protests are teeming with right-wing extremists. Here’s a brief look at some of the figures who have either organized or attended these events over the last week. A rally Monday in Augusta, the state capital of Maine, was organized in part by Larry Lockman, a white nationalist former state lawmaker who in 2017 warned that proposed immigrant welcome centers were tantamount to a “war on whites.” According to Maine-based journalist Nathan Bernard, Lockman helped coordinate Monday’s anti-shutdown event on the “Mainers Against Excessive Quarantine” Facebook page, where he encouraged attendees to show up to the rally wearing MAGA gear. “This is about the loss of our civil rights and its impact on our businesses and religion,” he wrote in one post. Bernard reported seeing Lockman coordinating a group of unmasked protesters at the rally Monday. In Columbus, Ohio, two men were photographed at an anti-shutdown protest holding up an anti-Semitic sign depicting Jews as rats, calling them “the real plague.” The Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism believes one of the men belongs to the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. According to the ADL, this individual was photographed at a 2019 white power rally with Timothy Wilson, who was killed by federal agents last month during an attempted arrest over his alleged plot to bomb a Missouri hospital during the pandemic in order to attract attention to his white supremacist views. A “Reopen Florida” protest scheduled for this weekend in Miami was organized by a leader of the neo-fascist street gang The Proud Boys, the Miami New Times reported this week. Enrique Tarrio, a longtime Proud Boy, admitted to the New Times that he’d organized the rally, which he’s advertised as being “against the Democrat-driven unconstitutional lockdown.” Members of the Proud Boys — a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group originally founded by bigot Gavin McInnes — have deep ties to a host of white nationalist and militia groups, and are best known for violently attacking their political opponents. Proud Boys have also been spotted at anti-shutdown protests in Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan. At the rally in Lansing, Michigan, Proud Boys were allegedly among the attendees blocking ambulances from being able to reach a hospital. Also in Michigan — as noted by reporter Jason Wilson in The Guardian — were members of the Michigan Liberty Militia, whose Facebook page Wilson notes “features pictures of firearms, warnings of civil war, celebrations of Norse paganism and memes ultimately sourced from white nationalist groups like Patriot Front.” An April 19 rally in Olympia, Washington, was well-attended by other anti-government militia groups, including the Oathkeepers and Three Percenters, whose members have been implicated in multiple anti-Muslim terror plots in recent years. Matt Marshall, leader of a state chapter of the Three Percenters, encouraged attendees ahead of the Olympia rally to wear Hawaiian shirts, a reference to the “Big Luau,” which is itself code for the “boogaloo,” a term used in white supremacist, militia and far-right circles to describe the bloody civil war they predict — and often hope — is coming to America. According to the ADL, anti-shutdown protesters in Tennessee and New Hampshire have been spotted holding up signs invoking the boogaloo. “Liberty or Boogaloo,” the signs have said, and “Join my boog squad.” In San Diego, an anti-shutdown protest this past Saturday was organized by Roger Ogden, who has previously held a series of far-right rallies in the city in coordination with the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters. “We do not believe that the COVID-19 bug represents such an immediate danger to others that constitutional rights should be curtailed,” Ogden told reporters at the San Diego rally, downplaying the virus as less severe than the flu. (COVID-19 is thought to be 10 times more deadly than the flu.) And in Idaho, rally scheduled for this Friday outside the state capital building in Boise is being advertised by Diego Rodriguez, a pastor and former Republican candidate for the state senate. Rodriguez recently held an Easter Sunday church service — in defiance of social distancing orders in the state — with Ammon Bundy, who led the militia occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. Anti-vaccination extremists, a mainstay of Trump rallies and other far-right events in recent years, have been seen at multiple anti-shutdown protests. An April 14 rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, was organized in part by an anti-vaccination activist named Ashley Smith. “I am against mandatory vaccination,” Smith said in an email to The News & Observer. “That is a personal right and as a sovereign citizen I have the right to choose what medical procedures I and my children receive. Pandemic status/state of emergency doesn’t change that.” Public health experts fear the anti-vaxx movement could, once a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, undermine a national inoculation program.

Owen Shroyer, a host on the conspiracy website Infowars, held a “You Can’t Close America” rally in the Texas state capitol last weekend, attracting hundreds of attendees. When Infowars founder Alex Jones arrived with a bullhorn, fans swarmed around him and jostled to shake his hand as Jones declared that the pandemic — which has already killed over 500 people in Texas — is a hoax. Investigations by The Washington Post and NBC News revealed that some of the largest Facebook groups organizing protests across the country were all founded by four brothers with a history exploiting far-right causes to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Dorr brothers — Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew — were the founders or administrators of the groups New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine, Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine, Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine and Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine. According to NBC News, the groups started or administered by the brothers, which have amassed some 200,000 members, direct people to websites owned by the Dorrs, which then directs people to register their names and addresses, or to sign up as dues-paying members for organizations promoting pro-gun, anti-abortion, or pro-Trump causes. But Republicans who have previously crossed paths with the Dorr brothers warn that such fundraisers have little to do with political organizing and more to do with lining the Dorrs’ pockets. Minnesota’s Senate Republican Caucus earlier this year warned voters about these Dorr “scams.” And Minnesota Citizens Concerned For Life, a prominent anti-abortion group, states on its website that the “Dorr brothers are established scam artists.” “Nothing they say can be believed,” the website says, “and giving them your money will not advance the pro-life cause in any way.” A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus Stay up to date with our live blog as we cover the COVID-19 pandemic What happens if we end social distancing too soon?

Florida's higher-speed passenger rail service Brightline announced Tuesday it will resume operating sometime in November, 20 months after it closed because of the pandemic and with safety measures that it hopes will curb a spate of fatal collisions that plagued its initial run. The privately run company, which began operations in 2017, will resume with hourly service between Miami and West Palm Beach, president Patrick Goddard said. Goddard said Brightline will require all employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 and, following federal regulations, mandate masks for crew and passengers inside its trains and stations.

Burke, Virginia residents are surprised to learn that they may be overpaying for auto insurance New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has resigned, citing a need for the state to move on from the sexual harassment scandal that has engulfed his administration. At a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Cuomo continued to deny many of the accusations of unwanted physical contact with women, before explaining that the situation had consumed the state’s attention while officials battled a resurgence of Covid-19. The state’s attorney general, Letitia James, previously released a report finding that sexual harassment accusations against the governor from nearly a dozen women were credible. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation Tuesday over a barrage of sexual harassment allegations in a fall from grace a year after he was widely hailed nationally for his detailed daily briefings and leadership during the pandemic's peak. “The best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to government,” Cuomo said.

As areas of Minneapolis shifted from peaceful protest against the death of George Floyd to looting, arson, and vandalism on Wednesday and Thursday night, the King Center — founded by Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow to promote MLK Jr.'s ""nonviolent philosophy and methodology"" — posted this excerpt from King's 1967 ""The Other America"" speech at Stanford University. Speaking two years after California's Watts riots in August 1965 and race riots in Harlem the previous summer, King spent a few minutes trying to explain the cause of rioting to his predominantly white audience. “In the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?” pic.twitter.com/Als3jhxaGH America has consistently ""taken a positive step forward on the question of racial justice and racial equality"" only to follow it with ""certain backward steps,"" King said. Because of widespread and widely ignored black poverty and racial injustice, ""all of our cities are potentially powder kegs,"" he added, and ""many in moments of anger, many in moments of deep bitterness engage in riots."" King continued: Let me say as I've always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. ... But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.

But we cannot give this man back to his family.” By Molly Hensley-Clancy Last updated on May 29, 2020, at 3:57 p.m. ET Posted on May 29, 2020, at 2:52 p.m. ET The ashes of the Gandhi Mahal restaurant are seen behind police in South Minneapolis on Friday morning. The first thing Hafsa Islam felt Friday morning, when she woke up in a neighborhood filled with acrid smoke, was anger. The restaurant in South Minneapolis that had been her family’s life’s work, Gandhi Mahal, had burned down in protests early Friday morning, days after George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Then Hafsa heard her father, Ruhel Islam, on the phone. “Let the buildings burn,” he was saying. “Justice needs to be served. Put those officers in jail.” Hearing her father’s words on the phone calmed Hafsa, who said she has always supported the Black Lives Matter movement. “It helped me realize what we were there for,” she said. “It has gotten to a point where this is the only way that we can get justice, and we can change the system.” Hafsa, 18, posted what her father had said on Gandhi Mahal’s Facebook page, hoping to help others understand why there were more important things at stake in the protests than buildings, she said. She was met with an outpouring of support from the community and promises to help the restaurant rebuild. Ruhel, an immigrant from Bangladesh, explained it this way: “Life is more valuable than anything else,” he said, hours after his restaurant had burned. “We can rebuild a building. But we cannot give this man back to his family.” News O’Clock is your daily look at what’s going on out there in the world beyond your quranteam. Catch up on all the episodes or subscribe on Apple Podcasts, the iHeart Radio app, Spotify, Google Podcasts, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows. In the wake of Floyd’s death, Hafsa had spent the past few days at Gandhi Mahal, which sits just a few blocks from the Minneapolis Police’s Third Precinct, in the heart of the neighborhood that has been the epicenter of the protests. She had seen medics carrying people injured in the protests. She’d seen nonviolent protesters stung by tear gas and rubber bullets. And she had even, she said, caught a glimpse of George Floyd as he was arrested a few blocks away. She was in her car, running DoorDash orders from her family’s restaurant. She even filmed a 5-second video on Snapchat, a blurry video showing police with a man on the corner where Floyd was arrested. “The first thing I noticed was his facial expression,” Hafsa said. “It brought that image to my mind. I remembered how he was crying and in pain.” She has thought of that expression, she said, as she watches the protests unfold in her city. “I think the people saying that people should stop protesting are wrong,” she said. The boarded up storefront of Moon Palace books, which was tagged with ""Do Not Burn."" As the protests and violence that erupted over Floyd’s death have reduced much of the south Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd was arrested to rubble, many have used the plight of small business owners as a cudgel against the protesters. To Ruhel, who grew up in a “police state” in Bangladesh, the forces that brought down his beloved restaurant were very clear. He places the blame on city leaders and local law enforcement who had failed to arrest the officers involved in Floyd’s death, before the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck was charged with murder Friday afternoon. The other three officers have not been charged. “They could have stopped this,” Ruhel said. “They need to put the police in jail. It should have been solved two, three days ago.” Other small business owners in Minneapolis have gone out of their way to support the protests, even with their buildings at risk as tensions continue to rise. The owners of Moon Palace, a local bookstore, condemned “indifference, violence, and more terrorizing by the police” in response to Floyd’s death. “We so appreciate all of the support we’ve been offered over the past two days, but we urge you: do not put yourself at risk to protect our store,” they wrote on Facebook. “The things that may be lost in our building are just things, but your life is priceless, just like George Floyd’s life was priceless.” Moon Palace's large glass windows were boarded up and tagged with ""Do Not Burn"" after reports emerged that the owners had refused to allow police to stage operations in their parking lot. Hafsa Islam and Ruhel Islam, in their garden. None of this, though, has lessened the pain of the loss of Gandhi Mahal, for Ruhel or for Hafsa. Ruhel tried to protect his building, he said: He stayed there this morning until 1 a.m., when he finally had no choice but to go home. “My heart is very broken,” he said of the damage done to his restaurant. “We want justice for our brother, but we don’t want to be destroyed. I see young people's anger. At the end, we believe in peace.” On Friday, Ruhel tried to examine the damage done to their restaurant. But police were blocking off the streets, he said, and he couldn’t get through. Around him, rubble still smoked. Instead, Ruhel and Hafsa went to the garden that they started nearby, called the Interfaith Garden, where Ruhel has long worked with other community groups to grow fresh vegetables and spices that are served at Gandhi Mahal. Ruhel tended to cilantro, beans, and fenugreek, a medicinal spice. Around them, the smoke was still so heavy that their throats burned. “I’m going to plant in the garden and pray for everyone,” Ruhel said. He has told Hafsa not to worry about the loss of their restaurant, which was their main source of income. “We’ll figure it out, don’t worry, we’ll work together,” he said he told her. “We’re growing a lot of food, vegetables, and I’m not worried. I’m going to start planting and growing and growing to survive.” Contact Molly Hensley-Clancy at molly.hensley-clancy@buzzfeed.com. Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

Fires have sprung up around the area as well. Gov. Tim Walz tweeted late Wednesday night, calling the situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue an ""extremely dangerous situation."" The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone's safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene. The protests are happening in response to the death of George Floyd, who was killed Monday night after an incident that involved Minneapolis Police officers. All four officers involved in the arrest were fired on Tuesday. Protesters were seen on Chopper 5 footage throwing bottles and rocks at law enforcement, while officers responded with rubber bullets, flash bombs and tear gas to push them back. Some looters at the East Lake Street Target location were seen walking out with televisions, rugs and other items from the store. Other looters were seen at a tobacco store, a Dollar Tree and a liquor store. Additionally, Cub Foods and an AutoZone is being looted as well. The AutoZone was set on fire as of 9:30 p.m. It could be seen burning on Chopper 5 video. A source has confirmed to KSTP that the city requested support from the National Guard late Wednesday night to combat the ongoing violent protests. A Target spokesperson made the following statement: ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing our community. We decided to close our Lake Street store earlier today and worked to ensure all of our team members were accounted for and safe. Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal. Until further notice, our store will remain closed."" KSTP has a crew on scene to gather more information. The Minneapolis Police Department said they are aware of what is happening in the area and are working on the matter. They advise all to stay out of the area for the time being. Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith shared her thoughts on the night's protests. I’m praying for peace and healing tonight in Minneapolis, as I hear sirens and explosions across our green city. Our community is in so much pain. Dr. King said, “I can only close the gap in broken community by meeting hate with love.” Metro Transit has announced that Routes 5 and 23 are being detoured around the area. Walz also posted a series of tweets earlier Wednesday night calling on people to be peaceful if they choose to protest. If you plan to turn your pain into action by joining a public demonstration, please do so peacefully and safely to protect your own health and the health of the people around you. That’s why I’m pushing for a full, fair, and expeditious investigation that will bring us closer to justice. We must continue to examine and address the systemic inequities and discrimination that led to this incident and far too many that have come before. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted a statement urging others to keep the peace. Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 Minneapolis Senators Jeff Hayden and Patricia Torres Ray also made a joint statement on Thursday saying: ""We, along with our constituents, are deeply heartbroken and outraged by the injustice that occurred in the officer-involved death of George Floyd. As our community continues to grieve and grapple with this incredibly unjustifiable loss of life, we believe in their right to peacefully protest. We have grown increasingly concerned, for the safety of the City of Minneapolis and its residents, as the demonstration has escalated. More than ever, our community must come together during this hard time and in this work to fiercely advocate for the justice that is needed. We are eager to effectively partner with community organizers, leaders, activists, and advocates to prevent the loss of another life due to excessive use of force.""  This is a developing story.

By Lam Thuy Vo Posted on May 31, 2020, at 4:09 p.m. ET A journalist is seen bleeding after police started firing tear gas and rubber bullets in Minneapolis on Saturday. As protests against police brutality continue around the country, more than a dozen journalists have been injured and arrested by police officers while working. Protests broke out in Minneapolis, then spread around the country, after George Floyd died Monday when a police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Floyd's pleas for his life, saying “I can’t breathe,” in an event that was captured on video echoed the killing of Eric Garner and brought renewed attention to the violence people of color face from police. Since then, journalists have been documenting the crowds of thousands who have gathered in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Seattle. “Targeted attacks on journalists, media crews, and news organizations covering the demonstrations show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them,” said Carlos Martínez de la Serna of the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement condemning police actions. “Authorities in cities across the U.S. need to instruct police not to target journalists and ensure they can report safely on the protests without fear of injury or retaliation.” Below are some of the injuries and arrests that have been captured through videos and images. Minneapolis Journalists from several news organizations have reported on social media that police have either arrested, harassed, or fired upon them with less-than-lethal force while covering ongoing protests. Minnesota police arrest CNN reporter and camera crew as they report from protests in Minneapolis https://t.co/oZdqBti776 On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his crew were arrested live on camera, despite identifying themselves as journalists and offering to move. They were released from police custody a few hours later. LA Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske posted a video of herself describing an encounter with Minnesota State Patrol officers during which she said a group of reporters identified themselves as press. The officers fired tear gas at the journalists “point-blank” without responding to the reporters’ pleas to tell them where they should go, she said. Minnesota State Patrol just fired tear gas at reporters and photographers at point blank range. Hennessy-Fiske said she was hit in the leg with a rubber bullet and posted a photo of her injury on Twitter: That’s the PG version of my leg courtesy of @MnDPS_MSP still going to report tonight and tomorrow A photographer and activist was also struck in the left eye with what she believed was a rubber bullet and said she has been permanently blinded in that eye: Hey folks, took a tracer found to the face (I think, given my backpack) and am headed into surgery to see if we can save my left eye Am wisely not gonna be on Twitter while I’m on morphine Stay safe folks Several other reporters have also said they have been pepper-sprayed or arrested: I was pepper-sprayed then arrested last night by Minneapolis PD even after identifying myself as a reporter MULTIPLE times: Cop 1: *checks press badge as I’m on the ground* Cop 2: “Roll on your side, Mr. journalist.” Cop 3: *loads me in the car, sees my press badge and shrugs* ""I'M NOT FIGHTING"": Tom Aviles, an award-winning photographer with CBS Minnesota, was arrested and struck by a rubber bullet while covering protests in Minneapolis. https://t.co/uIJsKYOboi MSNBC reporters were just almost hit with some sort of explosive device by law enforcement officers in Minneapolis Minneapolis police march on a parking lot where VICE reporter @MichaelAdams317 is sheltering.

Tim Walz apologized for the second time about the ongoing arrests. “It is unacceptable,” he said, adding he recognized the role journalists have to play in the protests. “I take full responsibility for that and won't equivocate no matter how difficult the environment is.” Denver NEW: Photographer Hyoung Chang was covering a George Floyd protest Thursday night in downtown Denver when police began firing cannisters of tear gas and balls loaded with pepper at the crowds. An officer fired two pepper balls directly at him, Chang said. https://t.co/PcWDZnQeBW In Denver, staff photographer Hyoung Chang for the Denver Post said police fired canisters of tear gas at the crowd and also fired pepper balls directly at him.

A WAVE 3 News reporter was also struck while on air.

Regardless of the intent, this seems to be a much smarter strategy than shooting the streets up with teargas. Chattanooga Chief of Police David Roddy made a post on Twitter saying that police officers who don’t have an issue with what happened to George Floyd should turn in their badges. There is no need to see more video. There no need to wait to see how “it plays out”. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this…turn it in. pic.twitter.com/frNCAWCeq6 — David Roddy (@ChiefDavidRoddy) May 27, 2020  The protests that have spread around the country in recent weeks are in response to the police killing of George Floyd. The Minneapolis police arrested officer Derek Chavin in hopes to quell the protests, but the demonstrations have continued and expanded throughout the country. Chauvin is the recently fired officer who was seen in the now-viral video in which Floyd was killed. Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he gasped for air and begged for his life. He has been with the Minneapolis Police Department for 19 years, and in that time, he has been involved in multiple shootings in which people were killed, and has had multiple excessive force complaints during his career. The case has become so controversial because of the blatant use of force shown in the footage, but also because the evidence shows that Floyd was entirely complaint and peaceful throughout the arrest, and that there was no reason to be so forceful with him. The incident is such a flashpoint across the country because it has become a symbol of the experiences that so many other people in the country have with police. Police initially said Floyd was resisting arrest and had a medical incident. However, surveillance video obtained by CBS News showed Floyd cooperating with the officers, and video of his death clearly shows that he was not resisting. The videos to initially surface of the incident showed the moments where officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck. In those videos, Floyd was not fighting or struggling with the officers at all, but police claimed that he was resisting after he was first taken out of his car. Now, surveillance camera footage that was released from a nearby restaurant shows Floyd being removed from his car by police without resisting. The new video shows him being taken from the car and placed in handcuffs, which means that he had no opportunity to resist. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two weeks later, alongside many of the same people who promoted those actions, protesters not only left their cars but entered that building, flanked by armed militias demanding that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer open the government and allow residents the freedom to return to work. Competing narratives have emerged surrounding this anti-lockdown movement, which has spread across the country and increasingly come to embrace anti-government conspiracy theories, dangerous pseudoscience, and occasional threats or acts of violence. To its supporters, the movement represents a grassroots expression of patriotic discontent over unconstitutional measures that infringe on liberty and cause economic hardship. To its detractors, the movement inflates perceived opposition to life-saving public health measures with help from dark money tied to the family of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Several media reports have previously linked Operation Gridlock to the influential DeVos family through an organization tangentially funded by them, which purchased $250 in Facebook advertisements to promote the April 15 event. While this connection is largely factual, it is quantitatively negligible and, more importantly, misses the bigger picture. By combining a sometimes second-by-second chronology of which users shared Facebook invites to the protests with hundreds of pages of campaign-finance records and local news reports, Snopes demonstrates that this anti-lockdown movement was originally pushed by a small circle of fervent activists who have been protesting almost constantly since well before the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, they have benefited from a political action infrastructure originally created to support the DeVos-funded, anti-union “right-to-work” movement. These methods have apparently created the perception of widespread discontent with public health measures largely supported by the American populace and are part of a campaign playbook self-evidently resulting in an increasingly radicalized base of Trump supporters as the 2020 general election approaches. Betsy DeVos’ family — whose wealth stems from father-in-law Richard DeVos’ success in creating and running the multi-level marketing company Amway — has financed libertarian political causes with an influence comparable to the Koch brothers’ for decades. The children of Richard DeVos, Sr. and their families, through at least five separate foundations, generally provide much of this financial support in a coordinated way as a family unit. To get a sense of the scale of their political involvement, note that in 2015 and 2016 the DeVos family made $14 million in political contributions, including substantial funding to the Michigan state Republican Party and other county-level GOP chapters. The link between the DeVoses and the Operation Gridlock event stems from the former’s support of an independent PAC, the Michigan Freedom Network, which received a combined $250,000 from five members of the Devos family on March 18, 2020. The Michigan Freedom Network owns and operates the website of the Michigan Freedom Fund, a political non-profit. The Michigan Freedom Network shares staff, finances, and other resources with both the Freedom Fund and with the DeVos-funded Great Lakes Education Project, which is an “advocacy organization supporting quality choices in public education.” The Michigan Freedom Fund, whose executive director is lobbyist Tony Daunt, was a co-host of the first Operation Gridlock event on Facebook. By email, Daunt told us the fund spent only $250 on Facebook ads to promote the protest. DeVos family spokesman Nick Wasmiller told us by email that the purpose of the DeVos family donations to the Michigan Freedom Network, which occurred in the same amount in 2016 and 2018, has always been to support candidates for state-level office, and that the money has always been earmarked for that and no other purpose: “Like the Michigan Freedom Network, the DeVos family advocates for policies that support a fair and open economy, accountable government, strong individual rights and opportunity for all. These shared principles have inspired DeVos family members – like many other Michigan residents – to periodically make contributions to MFN with the latest coming earlier this year. These contributions are restricted to support of state house candidates who are seeking office in the coming election cycle.” Since 2015, the Michigan Freedom Network has participated in at least 60 different state-level campaigns, but the assertion that the DeVos money does not go toward the fund — which received $51,032 from the Network between 2015 and 2018 — is unverifiable. In terms of direct financial support for this protest, however, the most one could reasonably argue might have come from the DeVoses via the Network would be $250 for Facebook ads. The Freedom Fund itself has minimized its connection to the Operation Gridlock protest as well. “The April 15 Operation Gridlock protest in Lansing was organized by a different organization — one unaffiliated with the Michigan Freedom Fund — called the Michigan Conservative Coalition,” Daunt told us. The Michigan Conservative Coalition is a collection of former Tea Party-aligned groups and pro-Trump organizations whose purpose is to recruit and train an “army of conservative activists,” most notably the groups Michigan Trump Republicans, Women for Trump, and the Lakes Area TEA Party. The people who run the coalition have deep ties to the Michigan GOP and to Trump campaign surrogates, and the coalition was founded by Meshawn Maddock and Marian Sheridan. Maddock is the wife of Republican state Rep. Matt Maddock and serves on the national advisory board for the group Woman for Trump. Sheridan is grassroots vice chair of the Michigan Republican Party and was a founding member of the Lakes Area TEA Party. Another Coalition leader, Rosanne Ponkowski, has served as co-chair of the Oakland County (Michigan) Republican Party. The separation between the Michigan Freedom Fund and the Michigan Conservative Coalition is not as clear as Daunt has claimed. Individuals from both organizations frequently collaborate on shared goals. Members of both organizations, for example, have been deeply invested in getting conservative members on the Michigan redistricting commission, which was created to limit political gamesmanship in the process of drawing new congressional districts in that state. Daunt, of the Michigan Freedom Fund, and Sheridan, of the Michigan Conservative Coalition, were both involved in a (failed) legal challenge against the Michigan secretary of state that criticized rules barring several individuals linked to the Michigan Conservative Coalition from serving on that redistricting commission. Eric Doster, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case, is the husband of Mary Doster, who is the treasurer of the Michigan Freedom Network. To test the theory that grassroots leaders connected to or trained by these organizations were responsible for the bulk of the early promotion of the Michigan anti-lockdown protests on Facebook that helped launch a nationwide movement, we created a database of all of the people and Facebook pages who shared invites to early Michigan lockdown protests. This research revealed a tightly knit community of political activists that has been protesting since well before the COVID-19 pandemic. This activist cohort uses a political action infrastructure linked to the 2012-era, anti-union right-to-work movement in Michigan, which occurred principally due to massive political spending by the DeVoses. We used the analytics tool Crowdtangle to collect a database of information on nearly 1,000 separate instances in which a Facebook account shared a lockdown-protest event page to a Facebook group in April 2020. We collected information from 39 different lockdown events across the country identified by key search terms, Facebook-recommended related events, and a list of protests advertised on the website of the libertarian-aligned group FreedomWorks (which has previously been supported by the DeVos family). The resulting report here concerns only data derived from Michigan, but the entire raw dataset, which includes other states, can be viewed here. The information produced by this process aligns with previously reported aspects of the lockdown protest’s suspicious social media behavior. For example, the largest and most frequently used groups to spread these events were ones created by the Dorr brothers, four pro-gun activists. They created several anti-quarantine groups and associated websites — including Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine — days before Operation Gridlock, which attracted hundreds of thousands of people, as reported by the Washington Post and NBC News. What our dataset adds to this discussion is an intricate chronology of the Michigan lockdown movement’s promotion on Facebook, allowing for the identification of a small group of activists who first pushed the protests’ online promotion and who subsequently received a disproportionate amount of media coverage. Our first step was to sort all instances of people sharing protest event pages chronologically. Doing so allowed us to view “bursts” of shares — times when a Facebook user either copy-and-pasted several invites to multiple groups manually, or times when, some of these Facebook users later told us, they used a recently allowed method for automatically posting to multiple Facebook groups at once. Joan Donovan, an online extremism expert and the research director of Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, told us that Facebook groups have been the backbone of protest movements going back to the Occupy Wall Street movement of the 2010’s, and that this multiple-post feature can be a powerful messaging tool for activists. “It works really well in memetic warfare campaigns because you can post the same meme to a bunch of different groups,” she told us in a phone interview. We term these multi-posters “boosters,” which we defined as an account that shared the same event to at least four groups separated by no more than 60 seconds. In our dataset, these instances are highlighted in yellow. The first two boosters who met this criterion were Rob Cortis and Cindi Holland. Via Facebook messenger and email, we reached out to Holland, who asked us to send questions by email but provided no response to our questions when we did. Via his website, we reached out to Cortis, who told us by email to contact him by phone but provided us with an incorrect number. A follow-up email with a list of questions had not been responded to as of this writing. Cortis is a well-known figure in Trump circles. One could argue he is equal parts activist and self-contained traveling side show, who since October 2016 has toured the country with a parade-style float dubbed the “Trump Unity Bridge.” A literal bridge on a trailer, this float is adorned with various Trump slogans and American flag iconography. Cortis and the bridge have become a fixture of Trump rallies and protests. Though he mostly supports his unity tour through donations, at least one political campaign has paid him. In 2017 and 2018, Cortis received $6,398.20 from the (unsuccessful) gubernatorial campaign of former Michigan state Sen. Pat Colbeck as reimbursement for “rental equipment.”  Holland, the second person in our database to promote Operation Gridlock to multiple groups, is the campaign director for a current political campaign, Mike Detmer for Congress. Detmer organized one of the caravans that traveled to Lansing for Operation Gridlock. This fact was noted in several publications because he briefly went viral for appearing in a photograph with a very non-social-distanced group of people that included a member of the Proud Boys flashing a “white power” symbol during the caravan meet-up. As of this writing, his campaign has received endorsements from two individuals: former Milwaukee County sheriff and current Trump surrogate David Clarke, and the aforementioned Cortis benefactor Colbeck. Another frequent booster of several Michigan lockdown protests was Londa Gatt, who serves as the grassroots director for the Detmer campaign and also as Midwest regional director for the pro-Trump organization Bikers for Trump, a massive organization with actual influence in the Trump administration. We asked Gatt about her Facebook promotion of the lockdown protests via Facebook messenger, and she responded with a voice recording asking us “Who are you really?” As part of her work on the Detmer campaign, and also in several instances that predate it, Gatt has frequently appeared at media spectacles that included Cortis and his Trump Unity Bridge. In 2017, for example, Gatt organized a Bikers for Trump event, which Cortis attended, that was meant to provide a “barrier wall” of protection between Kid Rock and a group of anti-Trump protesters at one of his shows.  Our database of boosters included other Cortis collaborators as well. In an event held a week after Operation Gridlock, Cortis and the Trump Unity Bridge were the featured attraction at a second lockdown-related protest outside of Gov. Whitmer’s house. This event, which protesters dubbed “Operation Queens Castle,” made national news despite its meager turnout. The event was pushed to several Facebook groups at the same time by Brandon Hall, who was also listed as the event’s host on Facebook. Hall is a self-described “lifelong political nerd,” a former Michigan Trump Campaign volunteer, and a felon somewhat infamously convicted of election fraud in 2014. “Gretchen Whitmer is tyranny, this is like a third world country. It’s like V for Vendetta and Idiocracy hooked up and they produced this baby that is 2020,” Hall told local news outlet Up North Live from outside Whitmer’s home.  Hall pushed the Queen’s Castle event to many of the same groups used by Cortis and Holland, including Auto Workers for Trump 2020. Brian Pannebecker, who was described in a September 2017 report as “a go-to source for reporters seeking comment from Trump backers in Michigan,” runs the Auto Workers Facebook group. Indeed, Pannebecker has been quoted as the voice of Michigan Trump supporters on a host of issues in a wide range of venues, including CNN and the Wall Street Journal, and has himself penned several opinion pieces lauding Trump published by his local newspaper. He has also attended multiple events with both Cortis and Hall.  Some combination of these above individuals, all of whom were involved in the promotion of the lockdown protests on Facebook, are disproportionately represented in past media accounts regarding pro-Trump demonstrations in Michigan. In September 2019, for example, Pannepacker, Cortis, and Gatt were each quoted or discussed in the Macomb Daily’s coverage of a “flash mob” meant to “counteract illegitimate attacks on the president.” Explaining her reason for attending this flash mob, participant Darlene Doetzel asserted to that newspaper that “fake news is out there every day, seven days a week telling lies.” Doetzel, it bears mentioning, is also one of the boosters identified in our database. She did not respond to requests for comment we sent by Facebook messenger and email. These observations do not demonstrate some elaborate and centralized pro-Trump conspiracy. Instead, they are notable because they suggest that the major impetus, when it comes to the people who promoted the lockdown events on Facebook and had their voices amplified in national or international media reports, was not so much the specific public-health measures meant to counter COVID-19. Rather, it was support of Trump in general. Their dedication to the anti-lockdown cause specifically is somewhat undermined by their history of supporting several attention-grabbing, pro-Trump causes dating back to 2016. In other words, they would likely still be holding protests and demonstrations in a non-pandemic reality. Furthermore, these observations make clear that a supposedly massive grassroots movement was — at least at its conception — principally the result of a much smaller number of activists who know how to create a media spectacle. “If Betsy DeVos is reading this,” Hall wrote to us on Facebook messenger when we asked about financial support for his activism, “Girl, I have NOT gotten the check the Twitter people and other radical liberals are saying I received.” Every protest organizer or promoter we contacted similarly denied receiving funds from anyone for their activism, and in most cases this is consistent with the evidence available to us via public records and campaign disclosures. Attempting to tie the DeVoses to these protesters or the movement they represent through the Michigan Freedom Fund’s $250 Facebook ad buy misses the substantial role played by the political action machine the DeVoses birthed in the early 2010s, which turned Michigan into a right-to-work state. The passage of right-to-work legislation in Michigan, an anti-union cause banning mandatory union dues as a condition of employment, was a major political coup. It almost certainly wouldn’t have occurred, according to many of the politicians involved, without the significant financial and political pressure applied by the DeVoses and the political action network they created to promote it. Following a 2009 victory that defeated a pro-union bill in the Michigan legislature, Dick DeVos, Jr. (husband of Betsy DeVos) and Ron Weiser, a former Michigan GOP chair, U.S. ambassador and “political guru,” began to strategize a path toward passing full right-to-work legislation. This path included recruiting from and fostering the grassroots activism of the Tea Party movement, financing candidates in local elections while promising support to candidates who faced tough reelection battles for their support of right-to-work, research on messaging, and lots of ad buys. The Michigan Freedom Fund — the same one that bought $250 worth of ads for Operation Gridlock — was explicitly founded to fund one of those ad buys.  Many of the activists we connected to the Facebook promotion of the early Michigan lockdown protests were also activists associated with the DeVos-Weiser push to get right-to-work legislation passed in Michigan. Pannebecker, of the group Autoworkers for Trump 2020, for example, has repeatedly referred to himself in media reports as a “spokesperson for Michigan Freedom to Work.” He has attended at least one Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference — an event historically financed in large part by organizations connected to or funded by the DeVoses — where he was photographed with DeVos associate Weiser. We asked Pannebecker on Facebook messenger if any connection existed between the freedom-to-work movement and his auto workers Facebook group and its use in promoting anti-lockdown measures, or if he has been paid by or supported by outside money. He simply replied “no.” While many of the people we identified as pushing these protests to multiple Facebook groups used Pannebecker’s Auto Workers for Trump 2020 group, several boosters — Cortis, Doetzel, and Hall — all used the Facebook group Lakes Area TEA Party for that purpose as well. While the Lakes Area TEA Party as an organization was founded by current Michigan Conservative Coalition leaders, the Facebook group was created in 2013 by Tim Bos, who rose to prominence as a former union worker who became “a vocal proponent” of the right-to-work movement. His Facebook profile states that he attended the Leadership Institute, described by the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets as “a decades-old nonprofit that provides training for conservative activists.” It receives significant funding from the conservative dark-money group DonorsTrust, which itself receives significant funding from the DeVos family. Bos did not respond to our request for comment. Former Michigan State Sen. Colbeck, whose campaign for governor paid funds to Trump Unity Bridge owner Cortis, is intimately linked to the DeVos political machine via right-to-work legislation. According to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, his rise as a Tea Party politician was heavily funded by DeVos money, and when he held elected office he advocated fiercely for their policies. As senator, he was one of the co-sponsors of the successfully passed Michigan right-to-work legislation. Colbeck, often as part of the Mike Detmer for Congress campaign, is a frequent speaker at pro-Trump events. He and Detmer were also all in attendance at Operation Gridlock and the later protest, the American Patriot Rally, that received widespread coverage due to the armed militias in the Michigan Capitol. Finally, as previously mentioned, Detmer’s campaign for Congress is currently run by Facebook booster Holland. Holland, who has appeared at several events with both Colbeck and Cortis and has worked closely alongside protest booster Gatt, is on the board of the Michigan Conservative Union. This organization appears to share a phone number, email address, and contact person with the group Michigan Freedom to Work — the same organization that Pannebecker has stated in past media reports to have been a spokesperson for. Again, this does not suggest a massive, centralized conspiracy orchestrated by the DeVos family to activate a past network of right-to-work activists to oppose restrictions on COVID-19 public health measures. What these connections instead show is that a small group of zealous activists identified by our database do not credibly represent the voice of grassroots citizens untouched by political influence. These individuals (as evidenced by their past activism) and the infrastructure they control (as evidenced by its creation for another political purpose) mobilized not for their objection to lockdowns specifically. Instead, the primary effect of their efforts by design seems to be energizing Trump’s base in an election year.   On June 11, 2019, a local Republican organization, the Michigan 10th Congressional District GOP, hosted its annual Ronald Reagan Dinner — a fundraiser headlined that year by National GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Trump Campaign Manager Brad Parscale. None of the attendees could have possibly known that a pandemic would be declared nine months later, necessitating a global wave of stay-at-home orders that would grind the global economy to a halt and fundamentally transform daily life in America and across the world. Yet virtually everyone identified in our dataset as boosting the anti-lockdown protests on Facebook, or associated with the Michigan Conservative Coalition, was in attendance at that dinner. Present were flash-mob attendee and protest booster Doetzel, Detmer campaign director protest booster Holland, Operation Queen’s Castle organizer and protest booster Hall, Trump Unity Bridge driver and protest booster Cortis, and Autoworkers for Trump’s Pannebecker. The Michigan Conservative Coalition’s Maddock, Sheridan, and Ponkowski were all there as well. So was Matt Seely, the current president of the Michigan Conservative Coalition. In his keynote address, Parscale accused Democrats of a litany of offenses related to immigration, healthcare, and environmental policy, telling the roused audience that, “It’s patriots like you who are going to stop them.” At the Michigan lockdown protest dubbed the “American Patriot Rally” less than a year later — attended by many who were in the audience of the Ronald Reagan Dinner — an armed militia entered the Michigan Capitol Building demanding the revocation of laws that health officials and epidemiologists say remain necessary to prevent further catastrophe. Another group organized an event that day alongside the Michigan Conservative Coalition’s efforts, and this second group may have been the one responsible for the armed protesters. But for many of the activists — armed or not — among the crowds gathered at the Patriot Rally, Operation Queen’s Castle or Operation Gridlock, these demonstrations were evidently a single battle in a years-long war whose previous fronts have included flash mobs, billboard-painting parties, anti-impeachment rallies, and Kid Rock concerts. To be sure, hundreds of people attended both Operation Gridlock and the American Patriot Rally. Many likely had no connection to previous activism and were motivated to attend out of a genuine frustration at the stay-at-home measures and a fear of economic uncertainty. Anti-lockdown sentiment has been “generated by people who are really angry and scared [and who] really see their governors and mayors as the problem behind this,” Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and co-author of the book “The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,” told us in a phone interview. On the other hand, as we have demonstrated in this investigation, the spark that ignited the movement owes itself in no small part to a small coterie of activists whose messaging appears to have been honed — at least in in some cases — in conservative activist training programs, and whose use of a political action machine exists thanks to millions of dollars of funding from a handful of billionaires. This “mixture of grassroots and top-down organizing” is what made the Tea Party movement of the early 2010s such a success, Williamson told us. “I am worried about that,” she added, “especially for the upcoming election, because if this movement basically generates more enthusiasm, they could become a force politically well beyond this one particular issue.” Whether the anti-lockdown movement will become a force to be reckoned with is unclear. Polls suggest a majority of Americans support the lockdown measures and oppose the lockdown protests, even when only people who have lost their jobs and are suffering economic hardship are polled. What is clear, though, is that the movement has already expanded well beyond one particular issue, and those issues are becoming dangerously divorced from reality. The Michigan Conservative Coalition’s website, at the time of this reporting, showcases the objectively false anti-vaccine conspiracy video “Plandemic.” The Facebook groups dedicated to the anti-lockdown cause are a fever swamp of conspiracy theories ranging from Bill Gates’ desire to track the global population through microchips in COVID-19 vaccines to the notion that a cohort of patriots under the leadership of someone referred to as “Q” will overthrow the “deep state.” A $250 Facebook ad buy from the DeVos-linked Michigan Freedom Fund did not create this coalition, nor did it single-handedly launch the anti-lockdown movement. The well-connected political action machine that originally created the Michigan Freedom Fund, however, has been objectively successful in presenting the fringe views of that movement as having widespread grassroots support in national media coverage. This increasingly radicalized base, and the tactics that gave rise to Operation Gridlock, will no doubt become a potent messaging tool as the 2020 general election approaches. Reporters seeking the views of Midwest conservatives will need to be aware, among many other things, that Trump supporters other than Pannebecker and Cortis exist in Michigan.

3925,https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/demonstrators-gather-in-downtown-slc-to-protest-police-brutality,Downtown SLC protest against police brutality escalates,"Menu  SALT LAKE CITY — A protest against police brutality in downtown Salt Lake City Saturday has escalated, leading to response from SWAT teams and the National Guard. The demonstration was one of multiple protests planned in response to the death of George Floyd, who died Monday in police custody after video showed a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes as he struggled to breathe and went unconscious. Organizers also say they are demonstrating for 22-year-old Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal, who was shot and killed by Salt Lake City Police one week ago. The department is expected to release body camera footage within 10 days of the incident. The protest was intended by organizers to be peaceful, but it gradually escalated as the Salt Lake City Police Department headquarters building was vandalized with spray-painted messages, and an unoccupied SLCPD vehicle has been overturned, smashed and set on fire at 200 East and 400 South. A Utah Transit Authority TRAX station was also damaged. Gov. Gary Herbert released a statement on the incident: “We are in close contact with our department of public safety and receiving regular updates. Our hearts break for the family of George Floyd. We are grateful for the swift actions taken by the state of Minnesota to hold those responsible for his death accountable. We can not, however, condone violence, defacement of public buildings, and destruction of property. We call upon the good people of Utah to engage civilly and to act peaceably as they seek to exercise their first amendment rights.” He later announced he will be calling in the National Guard.Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, news media, people traveling directly to and from work, traveling directly to and from the Airport, seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or those experiencing homelessness. Police have asked the public to avoid the Salt Lake metro area if possible. Many of the demonstrators have marched to the State Capitol, where Utah Highway Patrol are keeping anyone from going up the stairs leading to the building. SLCPD SWAT teams have now responded downtown along with agencies from surrounding areas. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has announced a curfew at 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday morning for the entire city. Mendenhall and SLCPD Chief Mike Brown said no one is allowed to be in public during that time even for traveling, but provided the following exceptions: Mendenhall and Brown held a press conference at 9 p.m. with an update on the curfew, asking the public to stay home and for protesters to go home. Brown also stated that six people had been arrested at the time. One officer was hit over the head with a baseball bat and is recovering in the hospital. Brown said if he had not been wearing a helmet, he would have likely been seriously injured or killed. About Us",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3958,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/31/china-state-media-george-floyd-protests-us-beautif/,China state media: George Floyd protests in U.S. a 'beautiful sight',"Sign In Manage Newsletters Where are the illegal immigrants going? ‘Closure’ of the 2021 Olympic Mental Games: Going for gold in the war on women Make way for more lockdowns A Chinese state newspaper called the riots in dozens of U.S. cities “retribution” for Washington’s support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, punctuating rising tensions Sunday between Beijing and President Trump. Mr. Trump has stepped up to the fight and announced that the U.S. is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization over its handling of China’s role in the coronavirus crisis. He also imposed fresh sanctions on Beijing and Hong Kong officials for their security crackdown on the financial hub. The president disclosed over the weekend that he is working to add India, South Korea, Russia and Australia to the Group of Seven nations’ annual summit. Aides said the move is partly aimed at confronting China’s rising influence. TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure billMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestream “For the first time, we have a president of the United States who is prepared to push back against [China’s threats] and protect the American people,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on Fox Business’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” The Global Times, a newspaper known as a Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, suggested in a column that Beijing would be justified if it openly backed the protests and riots in the U.S. that have prompted eight governors to call out the National Guard. The column, written by Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin, took aim at the Trump administration for threatening to impose sanctions on China over its new security law in Hong Kong. The newspaper also took aim at Mr. Pompeo and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. It mocked a statement Mrs. Pelosi made nearly a year ago that pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were “a beautiful sight to behold” at the time. “Now, the ‘beautiful sight’ is extending from Hong Kong to over a dozen U.S. states,” the paper said. “U.S. politicians now can enjoy this sight from their own windows.” The demonstrations and, in many cases violent rioting, began last week in Minneapolis, where George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer handcuffed him and knelt directly on his neck for nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. “A quick question for Pelosi and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: Should the Chinese government and National People’s Congress issue a statement to support the protests by African-Americans and the grassroots of U.S. society?” Mr. Hu wrote. “It seems to be what Beijing should do according to the logic of Washington cheering for the rioters in Hong Kong.” Mr. Pompeo implicitly criticized the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping. “It’s a different Chinese Communist Party today than it was 10 years ago,” he said. “This is a Chinese Communist Party that has come to view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideals, Western democracies, Western values, and puts Americans at risk,” he said. “The list is long, whether it’s stealing American intellectual property, destroying hundreds and millions of jobs here in the United States, further efforts to put at risk sea lanes in the South China Sea, denying commercial traffic.” White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said the president’s decision to pull the U.S. out of WHO was designed to force the international organization to end its “reliance on China.” “We’re going to beat this COVID disease that was unleashed on us and came from China,” Mr. O’Brien said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But in the meantime, we’re going to take that $440 million that the U.S. spends, compared to the $40 million that the Chinese spend on the WHO, and we’re going to make sure it gets to front-line health care workers.” Mr. Trump announced Friday that the U.S. was terminating its relationship with WHO over its handling of the coronarvirus crisis and took actions to punish China for misleading the world on the virus and for its security crackdown on Hong Kong. The president also announced he was ending U.S. preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong. He said Hong Kong is no longer a separate territory because Beijing moved to curb its autonomy. “Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world,” Mr. Trump announced in the White House Rose Garden. “The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations. These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside.” Deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 rose to nearly 104,000 on Sunday. Business shutdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus have thrown roughly 40 million Americans out of work in less than three months. The president said the sudden hardship wrought by the virus was one reason he insisted on attending the first manned space launch in the U.S. in nine years on Saturday in Florida. “It’s such a great inspiration for our country,” Mr. Trump said of the Space X launch. “We think next year is going to be one of the best years we’ve ever had, economically. We suffered something that was terrible. It should have never happened. It should have never come out of China, but it did. They didn’t stop it. They were unable, probably, to stop it.” The president is imposing sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials who are involved in restricting freedoms in Hong Kong. He also is moving to end Hong Kong’s preferential trading status with the U.S. “He’s asked us to review every preferential treatment that Hong Kong had and work to eliminate it. It no longer make sense,” Mr. Pompeo said. The administration also is suspending the entry of “certain foreign nationals from China” as potential security risks. The president’s move will affect a small percentage of the approximately 360,000 Chinese students in the U.S., including graduate students and researchers with ties to the Chinese military. The president said Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong “is a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China and, indeed, the people of the world.” “China claims it is protecting national security, but the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society,” Mr. Trump said. “Beijing’s decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of China’s invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of liberty. China has replaced its promise formula of ‘one country, two systems’ with ‘one country, one system.’” Rep. Chris Smith, New Jersey Republican and a leading congressional critic of China’s human rights record, said past administrations answered China with “cheap rhetoric” that emboldened its communist rulers. “President Trump, however, is beginning to change that and is doing what previous presidents have failed to do,” Mr. Smith said. “For the sake of oppressed people, the United States — even if we have to go it alone — must impose sanctions.” The State Department outraged Chinese leaders last week by declaring that U.S. leaders officially assess that Hong Kong no longer has the legal and economic freedom that the Chinese government promised under its treaty with Britain that gave the former colony back to Beijing in 1997. Chinese media accused Mr. Trump of hypocrisy with his sanctions over Hong Kong’s protests. “Trump really had the nerve to make the announcement when a group of furious Washington citizens were storming toward the White House,” the Global Times column said Saturday. “Washington must have failed to anticipate that retribution could come that fast. It should be thinking about it though.” In classic pro-China propagandist fashion, the Global Times column characterized the U.S. demonstrations as equivalent to protests against Chinese communist authoritarianism that have been rocking Hong Kong in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets in the territory to push back against the Chinese communist government’s gradual moves to strip the global financial hub of freedoms and governmental autonomy. Citing the clashes in American cities, the Global Times claimed that it is “as if the radical rioters in Hong Kong somehow snuck into the U.S. and created a mess.” The column suggested that the U.S. protests were a kind of punishment for Mr. Trump over his policy on Hong Kong and said the U.S. political system is “declining” at an “accelerating” rate. It sought to cast the authoritarian communist government in Beijing as superior. “The odds of outbreaks of riots in the U.S. are much higher than they are in China,” it claimed. “How could politicians in Washington possibly define the disturbances in other countries as ‘beautiful sights’ publicly? It is stupid to do so simply because they want to attack China. Let’s wait and see which country will encounter more chaos.” • Tom Howell Jr. and Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

3963,https://theintercept.com/2020/05/17/trump-salutes-long-island-protest-hang-fauci-sign-displayed/,"Trump Salutes Protest Where ""Hang Fauci"" Sign Was Displayed","© First Look Institute. All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Donald Trump praised protesters who harassed a journalist on Long Island this week at a rally where one man called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci. The president of the United States voiced his support on Saturday for a protest against New York state’s public health orders that was backed by an anti-government militia and anti-vaccine activists who called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s senior immunologist. The “Re-Open NY” rally on Thursday in Commack, New York was organized by a group of Trump supporters who call themselves the Setauket Patriots, but also endorsed by anti-vaccination activists and the Long Island branch of the Oath Keepers, a national organization of current and former law enforcement officers and military veterans who think they are defending the nation from a range of imaginary threats posed by the federal government. Amid a sea of American flags and Trump banners, several of the signs waved by the protesters referenced conspiracy theories promoted by radical anti-vaccine activists that demonize Fauci and the philanthropist Bill Gates. A protester at a rally in Commack, New York on Thursday displayed a sign calling for the execution of the nation’s leading immunologist and a billionaire philanthropist. Photo: News 12 Long Island In addition to placards calling for New York to open businesses, others displayed at the rally channeled conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists who believe that Bill Gates is somehow behind the crisis. “Just Say NO to Bill Gates,” read one sign. Another, with idiosyncratic punctuation, read: “My Son’s Are Not Lab Rats For Bill Gates Vaccine.” The protest outside a shuttered department store was attended by just a few hundred people, but it drew national attention after a local news reporter, Kevin Vesey, posted video of himself being harassed by demonstrators. The level of anger directed at the media from these protestors was alarming. As always, I will tell a fair and unbiased story today. pic.twitter.com/5jCR0YY9VH The protesters echoed the president’s anti-media harangues by complaining to Vesey that his channel, News 12 Long Island, had “stopped airing the Trump briefings,” and taunted him with the chant, “Fake news is not essential.” One woman told the reporter, “You’re the virus.” Another accused him of “destroying Suffolk and Long Island” through his reporting on the coronavirus crisis. Suffolk County, where the protest took place, has been among the worst hit in the United States, with 37,942 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,733 deaths as of Saturday. That means the suburban New York county of just under 1.5 million people has a mortality rate more than 4 times the national average. One of those cases was News 12’s Vesey, who tested positive last month and recently recovered from a relatively mild case of the illness. During a longer Facebook Live report from the demonstration, Vesey was menaced at close range by a man in a Trump hat and shirt who was not wearing a mask but said that he did not need to keep his distance because, “I got hydroxychloroquine; I’ll be fine, bro.” The man held a sign that called on one side for New York’s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, to be deposed, and on the other accused his brother, Chris Cuomo, of lying about his bout with Covid-19. Another protester held up a sign saying Fauci “has to go” and falsely asserted that he “works for” for the World Health Organization. The television report Vesey filed on Thursday evening included video of one of the demonstrators displaying a sign for the camera that read: “Hang Fauci, Hang Gates, Open Up All Our States.” I'll probably never forget what happened today.I was insulted. I was berated. I was practically chased by people who refused to wear masks in the middle of a pandemic.All the while, I was there to tell THEIR story. Here's the finished product. pic.twitter.com/HV2Hrcs7gi On Saturday morning, in a tweet that echoed his infamous praise for white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville in 2017, Trump described the protesters who had harassed the reporter as “Great people!” James Robitsek, a leader of the pro-Trump Setauket Patriots group that organized the protest, confirmed in a Facebook message on Saturday that his call for opponents of the lockdown to rally had been supported by the local chapter of the anti-government Oath Keepers militia. “They copied my post and made up their own for their group,” Robitsek said of the Oath Keepers. “They come to our events and vice versa. We all share events, our group is only 40-50 members.” Thursday’s gathering, he said, included “many people from other groups, or who just saw the post and wanted to come down.” The Oath Keepers’s name is a reference to the belief of its members that they are bound by their pledge to “defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” even if that means defying the government. As Justine Sharrock reported for Mother Jones in 2010, a year after the group was founded, some of the group’s first members were convinced then that it would not be long “before President Obama finds some pretext — a pandemic, a natural disaster, a terror attack — to impose martial law, ban interstate travel, and begin detaining citizens en masse.” In an open letter posted online last month, the Long Island branch of the militia group echoed that belief, by declaring that the state’s orders to shut down businesses, churches and public gatherings were the acts of “an overbearing government acting under the guise of benevolence” and had created “an untenable situation” that justified resistance. “Any government, or governing representative which acts in such a manner, attempts to act outside of the Constitution, and must be put on notice as doing such,” the group wrote. The national group’s founder, Stewart Rhodes, a libertarian trial lawyer and former Ron Paul staffer, mocked Trump earlier this week for tweeting in support of protesters in Pennsylvania who want to re-open businesses. “Uh, they are using YOUR Admin’s guidelines, including the Orwellian ‘essential/non-essential’ paradigm, which is like something out of the USSR,” Rhodes tweeted back at the president. On Twitter, Rhodes has also shared anti-vaccine conspiracy theories related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including one meme that described Gates as a “vaccine pushing globalist eugenicist” and urged readers “to REFUSE to take ANY vaccine he funds, ‘mandatory’ or not.” He also encouraged his followers to listen to a podcast in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attacked Gates and boosted a conspiracy theory about Fauci. The baseless smear on Fauci was first made by a discredited scientist who claims, without evidence, that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director buried her research about how vaccines can damage people’s immune systems. Those false claims about Fauci and Gates have been spread widely by the pro-Trump conspiracy group QAnon and by prominent anti-vaccine activists who have taken a leading role in recent protests demanding an end to the emergency public health orders in California, Texas and New York. Robitsek, the Setauket Patriots’ leader, insisted that three of the people seen in Vesey’s video harassing the reporter were “not associated with our group” and suggested that at least one of them — the man who had refused stay away from the reporter — might have been “a plant by left leaning groups in the area who were against our rally coming to Commack.” If so, the man has been under deep cover for some time, since a photograph on the Setauket Patriots Facebook page shows that he was also at a previous protest at the same spot two weeks ago. On that occasion, which was also covered by Vesey for News 12 Long Island, the man made no attempt to harass the reporter and did nothing to tarnish the reputation of the protesters. As for the woman who told Vesey he was the virus, Robitsek called her “a wacko,” and noted that she travels to protests all across the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut provoking confrontations and filming them for her group’s Facebook page. Robitsek, who said that he has been unemployed for almost nine weeks and is yet to receive any payment from the state, cast the rally as a non-partisan attempt to push New York to let people earn a living. “We all need to work,” he said. “Give me my unemployment, and I’ll stay home then but I need to pay my bills and eat. People are getting desperate.” Anxious to counter the negative publicity generated by Vesey’s video, Robitsek also suggested that a “local moms group” that was opposed to the rally had been “in cahoots with the media before it even started.” But the only evidence he could cite for that was a screenshot of a Facebook post from a member of the group Commack Parents Network, in which she had simply passed on an interview request from Vesey, saying that he would like one or more of them to explain why they were opposed to the re-opening protest taking place in their town. Robitsek also said that his group had agreed not to wave Trump flags, in a bid to be bipartisan, but many members of other groups who came to the rally did so. For his part, Robitsek wore what appeared to be one of Trump’s red caps, albeit a more understated one — with “USA” stitched on the front and “45” on the side — and a mask, while carrying an American flag. In addition to his group and the Oath Keepers, Robitsek said, members of the Conservative Society for Action also attended the rally, as did, “a bunch of anti-vaccine people.” Updated: Monday, May 18 1:12 a.m. PDTThis article was updated with a new headline.

The demonstration was called in solidarity with protests that have spread across the U.S. in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and to demand action against racism in Canada. Organizers and activists pled for a peaceful rally ahead of the 5 p.m. event. NEWS 1130’s Patrick Swadden said those wishes were being honoured. “We could just see the crowds gathering before we even got here and then we stepped out onto the plaza and there are people as far as you can see. It’s so far just been an incredibly peaceful protest,” he explained. “During the moment when everybody had their fists in the air, you could absolutely hear a pin drop.” Absolute silence during this moment @NEWS1130 pic.twitter.com/HR3z11HI9I — Patrick Swadden (@PSwadden) June 1, 2020  Chants of “Black Lives Matter” echoed through the plaza.

Protesters claiming the Covid-19 pandemic was a “scam” gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne on Saturday, and carried signs declaring they were against vaccines and 5G technology.  Their placards claimed “5G = communism”, “Covid 1984” and “our ignorance is their strength”. They booed police – clad in gloves and face masks – who warned the crowd that they were breaching social distancing rules designed to slow the spread of coronavirus. In a statement, police said those found in breach of Covid-19 directions faced fines of $1,652 each. In Sydney, up to 500 protesters voiced conspiracy theories regarding not only vaccination but also 5G telecommunication networks, fluoride and large pharmaceutical corporations.

The company announced the closings on its website. Target had initially closed more than 170 stores, but allowed some stories to reopen on Sunday. According to the list on the website Sunday morning, in addition to closing 33 stores in Minnesota, Target is closing 46 stores in California, two in Colorado, two in Georgia, seven in Illinois, one in Michigan, one in New York, eight in Oregon, three in Pennsylvania, and three in Texas. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country. At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores. We anticipate most stores will be closed temporarily,” the company said in a statement. The company noted in its statement that it was concerned about the safety of its employees. “Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal,” the statement said. “We are providing our team members with direct communications updates regarding any store impact where they work. Additionally, team members impacted by store closures will be paid for up to 14 days of scheduled hours during store closures, including COVID-19 premium pay.

I couldn’t believe this was happening in Eugene, Oregon. “And I was just so devastated that the protesters that came out, who were rightfully angry, tried to have a peaceful protest, but were completely overtaken by people who wanted to commit crime and be violent,” she said.

4425,https://god.dailydot.com/scenes-from-george-floyd-protests/,30 Scenes From George Floyd Protests Across The World,"May 31, 2020, 6:31 am* For the past several days and nights, protests have sprung up in numerous cities against police brutality and state violence against black men and women. They began in Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd was killed by Officer Derek Chauvin, who leaned on Floyd’s throat for eight minutes as he begged to be released, saying he could not breathe. The horrific scene was caught on tape and widely shared. As peaceful protesters were met with even more violence, including tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, tensions exploded. A police precinct was taken over and set on fire. Riots and looting took over many areas. Soon the city was put under a curfew, but it was too late to quell the rebellion. People all across the U.S. are fed up with the violence perpetrated by cops, especially racially motivated attacks against black citizens. Protests have sprung up in almost every state, in numerous cities. While most of these protests have started out as peaceful marches and gatherings, many have escalated as militarized police forces turn their weapons on the people, seemingly with impunity. Journalists have been arrested and targeted, even while cameras are running. There is a stark contrast of enforcement responses to anti-lockdown #protests where armed white civilians stormed gov’t buildings & others are on camera shoving police vs. nationwide #protests against police violence, where targeted arrests & use of force are deployed by police. https://t.co/rCcqBR9O7C — Dreisen Heath (@dreisenheath) May 30, 2020  It’s unclear how things will end, but after months of lockdown and over 100,000 people dead of a virus the government has failed to contain, plus a looming depression, people are not going to be placated by platitudes anymore.

4510,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-barack-obama-puts-guidelines-work-amid-george/story?id=70996007,Former President Barack Obama puts out guidelines to 'get to work' amid George Floyd protests,"The former president wrote about how to use this moment to make ""real change."" Communities come together in wake of George Floyd’s death Former President Barack Obama published a piece on Medium on Monday addressing the protests nationwide following the death of George Floyd -- and, specifically, how he thinks people can move forward to ""sustain momentum to bring about real change."" ""Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times,"" he wrote. ""But I believe there are some basic lessons to draw from past efforts that are worth remembering."" His message overall stressed the importance of voting and participating in politics, particularly at the local level, where decisions on ground-level criminal justice and police practices are formed. The ""bottom line,"" he wrote, is that ""if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn’t between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform."" The nation's first and only African American president began by acknowledging that ""the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States,"" noting that most people demonstrating have been ""peaceful, courageous, responsible, and inspiring."" He also noted that ""police in cities like Camden and Flint have commendably understood"" that the protesters ""deserve our respect and support."" He also addressed the violence that has broken out at protests in several cities, although the exact root of that violence has been disputed, especially as it differs between locations. In his post, Obama requested people ""not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" From there, Obama addressed the importance of participating in politics and voting in every election, saying that ""the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels."" He said reform agendas will vary from place to place but should be tailored to each community and that it's up to organizers to educate themselves of what strategies work best. ""The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away,"" he wrote. Obama concluded his letter by acknowledging the pain in America, amid protests and a pandemic. ""I recognize that these past few months have been hard and dispiriting -- that the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and hardship of a pandemic have been compounded by tragic reminders that prejudice and inequality still shape so much of American life,"" he wrote. ""But watching the heightened activism of young people in recent weeks, of every race and every station, makes me hopeful."" He said the next moment in American history can be ""a real turning point"" if ""we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action."" The post also linked up to a toolkit developed by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, based on a task force on policing Obama formed while at White House, and also to resources at the Obama Foundation, he said, ""to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action."" Later Monday, Obama summarized the essay in a series of tweets, saying in part: ""Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times."" This is the second time the former president has written something on the nation's unrest in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America,"" Obama wrote in a statement posted to Twitter Friday. ""It can't be 'normal.' If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has taken a different approach, facing some criticism for failing to address and unify the nation as protests grew over the weekend. Hours before Obama issued a statement Friday, Trump tweeted about the protests in Minneapolis, saying that ""thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd"" and, referencing the military, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet was flagged by Twitter as ""glorifying violence."" Trump on Sunday blamed ""ANTIFA"" for the protests turning violent and said he would label it as a terrorist organization, although his authority to deem a domestic group a terror organization remains unclear. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4591,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dallas-man-loses-eye-to-police-sponge-round-during-george-floyd-protest-attorneys/,"Dallas man loses eye to ""non-lethal"" police round during George Floyd protest, attorneys say","Watch CBSN Live  Updated on: June 4, 2020 / 3:40 PM / CBS News Dallas — Brandon Saenz was in a crowd protesting police brutality Saturday when he says he became a victim of it. ""All I heard was a boom. I got hit,"" Saenz said. ""I put my hands up, and I put my hand on my eye, and then I took off running,"" he said. The 26-year-old said he did nothing to provoke being shot with a non-lethal sponge round, but as a result, attorneys say, he lost his left eye, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. ""It is ironic that a protest about excessive use of force and police brutality ends with excessive use of force and police brutality,"" said Jesuorobo Enobakhare, who chairs the Dallas Police Oversight Board. Protesters have called for the Police Oversight Board to resume regular meetings that stopped during the coronavirus shutdowns. Next week it will. On its agenda will be votes on whether to investigate how the Dallas Police Department handles protests, as well as an incident that happened Monday night when hundreds of protesters walked onto the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. CBS DFW said it heard bangs and saw smoke, and saw a protester being carried away. ""She was flash-banged by police officers for walking peacefully,"" said the person helping her from the scene. Dallas Police Oversight monitor Tonya McClary, who reports to the board, said her office has seen a surge in complaints in the last two days. ""Our voicemail is almost full. We're still going through emails. What we've been able to get through right now is about 100,"" she said. Some cases, like Saenz's, have been fast-tracked and are already under investigation. McClary said some complaints against officers may be tossed out. Others could lead to discipline. The most serious cases could result in criminal investigations of officers involved. She said her office will independently review the department's decisions and, if it disagrees with any, can launch its own investigation. She and the board will also be able to look at the bigger picture and recommend any policy changes for the Dallas Police Department as a whole. The board is asking for photos, videos and first-hand accounts from the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge protest. First published on June 4, 2020 / 1:07 PM © 2020 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The demonstrations began in the U.S. when George Floyd died on May 25 after a police officer had pressed a knee into his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds while detaining him in Minneapolis. The protests are now spreading around the world to Europe, Africa and other regions. ""WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds,"" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on June 8. The demonstrations have prompted fear that the close contact of thousands of marchers could lead to a spike in case counts — which hit a new high on Sunday, with 136,000 cases reported that day. Modelers say it's difficult to assess how the protests will influence COVID-19 infections. Because COVID-19 generally has an incubation time of up to two weeks, public health officials think it will take a couple of weeks before they see the impact. But it's clear that a key ingredient for transmission is present at many of these rallies: close contact. The images of protesters standing shoulder to shoulder — some wearing face masks, others not — raise concerns, especially in cities with higher rates of infection. To that end, Tedros recommends that protesters follow the guidance of local health officials and take precautions to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus. ""We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely,"" he said, ""Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest."" He also advised people to maintain a safe distance from others — and to stay home if they are sick. ""The riskiest situation to be in is to be in close proximity to a case, particularly a symptomatic case, of COVID-19,"" said Michael Ryan, director of WHO's health emergencies program at the Monday press conference, so healthy people protesting next to one another may not meet the definition of coming in contact with the disease. However, it's become clear to researchers that the new coronavirus can be spread by people who aren't showing symptoms of it. ""Local public health official[s], on the basis of abundance of caution, could advise people either to quarantine or to get tested [after attending a mass gathering],"" Ryan said. Local officials have expressed similar worries about the interplay of the protests and the pandemic. Last week Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was concerned about what mass gatherings in the streets ""could mean for spikes in our coronavirus cases later."" She urged protesters to consider their exposure and consider being tested. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced free tests for demonstrators. Officials in Atlanta and New York have suggested testing as well. ""Testing everyone that participated in demonstrations would be useful in communities where many new cases are being reported every day. These new cases indicate that transmission is occurring at a high rate in the communities,"" said Bill Miller, an epidemiologist and physician at Ohio State University. He said an alternative to testing everyone would be active contact tracing. ""With new cases, the tracers could ask about demonstration participation, including days and times,"" Miller said. Then, if cases are linked to a demonstration, a call could go out to get everyone who participated in that event to be tested. Being outdoors seems to reduce the risk of exposure because the virus can't survive long in sunlight and there's better air circulation, but it's no guarantee against infection. Health experts warn that some activities linked with the protests — such as riding public transportation to attend rallies or getting arrested and jailed indoors with others — could increase a person's risk of getting exposed to the virus. Meanwhile, protests are expected to continue in the days ahead. George Floyd's burial service will take place on Tuesday at a private service in Houston.

4703,https://www.millennialmillie.com/post/undercover-investigation-minneapolis-riot-was-preplanned,Undercover Investigation - Minneapolis Riot Was Preplanned,"HOME ACCESS GALLERY NEWS SHOP CONTACT More We have sources imbedded within these groups to get to the bottom of where all this leftist radicalization is coming from. We got their plans, manuals, intercepted internal communications, and have recordings of their zoom chats. What you are about to see is part of a two year undercover investigation into the leftist radicalization imbedded within the climate justice movement that contributed to the riots in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this first video, we are going to show how the Sunrise Movement played a preemptive role in carrying out the mayhem, taking advantage of George Floyd's death and using it as a trigger point, to further push their Green New Deal agenda and promoting the abolition of the police. We didn’t expect to find organizers radicalizing middle school and high school children teaching them military tactics and preparation for high risk actions. Some of these tactics include escalation provocation techniques, blocking freeway traffic, and how to get arrested bogging-down law enforcement in the name of destroying capitalism to make way for the Green New Deal. What some parents may have though were innocent youth organizations genuinely fostered and ran by children are actually top-down monolithic structures with private intelligence, military contractors, and foreign interests influencing children to carry out their subversive objectives. The events that erupted in Minneapolis, Minnesota were not a spontaneous reaction to the murder of George Floyd. These were well planned events anticipating some perfect trigger point to bring about the “new normal” - a world without police, without borders, without industry, without wealth, without private property, without an economy - a world based on communist ideals imbedded within the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is not about climate change, it is about climate justice - a radical new ideology hellbent on destroying western civilization under the false pretense that white supremacy is the leading cause of climate change, social injustice and all problems globally. The organizers of these Youth Non-government Organizations, or Youngos, embellish white supremacy as a systemic problem, hyper-focusing on statistically rare instances of racial inequality and injustice, while ignoring great strides of progress the United States has made over the past century towards equal opportunity and criminal justice reform. However, in order to normalize radical policies put forth by the Green New Deal, crises have to be capitalized on to further their agenda while destroying the great accomplishments of civil rights movements of the past.

4736,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52945190,Buffalo police riot squad quit to back officers who shoved man,"An entire tactical unit of a US police department has quit after two officers accused of brutality were placed on unpaid leave, reports local media. In a video that went viral on Thursday, officers in the city of Buffalo, New York, were seen shoving an elderly man to the ground. The 75-year-old was seriously injured, and taken to hospital. All 57 officers in the riot squad have now reportedly resigned in protest at their two colleagues' suspension. According to the Buffalo News, the members have stepped down from the Emergency Response Team, but not the police department itself. John Evans, president of the local police union, told the newspaper: ""Our position is these officers were simply following orders from Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia to clear the square. ""It doesn't specify clear the square of men, 50 and under or 15 to 40. They were simply doing their job. I don't know how much contact was made. He did slip in my estimation. He fell backwards."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday the two officers should be fired, and called for the incident to be investigated for ""possible criminal charges"". In a statement, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said: ""We can confirm that contingency plans are in place to maintain police services and ensure public safety within our community."" He added that Buffalo police are continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies. The officers were enforcing a curfew as a result of protests that have spread nationwide since the death in Minneapolis last month of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The man is seen approaching a group of riot police as they advance. Two of the officers appear to push the 75-year-old, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had ""tripped"" and fallen during a ""skirmish involving protesters"". Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident. His name is Martin Gugino, and authorities said he was taken to hospital, where he was in a stable but serious condition on Friday. Mr Gugino is a longtime social justice activist in Buffalo, according to advocacy group Push (People United for Sustainable Housing). He ""has been a tireless fighter against injustice of all types for many years in our city both with Push and other grassroots organisations,"" they said in a statement, condemning police for his treatment.

4757,https://www.dailywire.com/news/democrats-block-republican-police-reform-bill-kill-hope-of-passing-legislation-amid-protests,"Democrats Block Republican Police Reform Bill, Kill Hope Of Passing Legislation Amid Protests","Democratic Senators have blocked a Republican police reform bill, leaving the legislation dead on the floor of Congress and likely defeating any Federal attempt to address police reform as a whole. The bill failed before its text ever made it to the floor. Democrats were able to marshal their caucus to defeat a vote designed to bring the issue to the floor for debate and killed the bill 55-45. A total of 60 votes would have been necessary to move the bill forward. “Republicans had 53 votes, but not enough Democrats joined them,” Fox News reports. Only Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) crossed partisan lines. Democrats fought the Republican bill, led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), which they said did not go far enough in addressing critical issues at the crux of police reform. The bill did not ban the use of chokeholds outright, preferring instead to warn departments to craft their own policies against the practice or risk losing federal funds. The bill also shied away from outlawing so-called “no-knock” warrants, preferring instead to establish a national database to track those warrants’ use and abuse. The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has its own bill which the Democratic caucus plans to bring to the floor there on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was apoplectic about the situation in an interview that took place just after the procedural vote failed. “The Senate was supposed to officially take up police reform on the floor today. Instead, our Democratic colleagues are poised to turn this routine step into a partisan impasse,” he told reporters, adding that the bill could have been the subject of debate and compromise, but Democrats refused to come to the bargaining table. McConnell called Democrats’ strategy in proposing the bill “bizarre,” particularly given that they refused to even agree to debate the measure. “They don’t want a debate, they don’t want amendments, they’ll filibuster police reform from even reaching the floor of the Senate unless the majority lets the minority rewrite the bill behind closed doors in advance,” McConnell said. The lead up to Wednesday’s vote has been acrimonious, sometimes to a shocking degree. Speaking late Tuesday, Pelosi accused Republicans, including Scott — the first black man to serve in both the House and Senate — of “trying to get away with murder, actually – the murder of George Floyd.” When pressed on the fact that her statement could be considered racially charged, Pelosi refused to apologize. On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attacked McConnell directly, warning the ranking Republican that he did not have “Civil Rights leaders” on his side. Since it is unlikely that the Senate will take up any House bill on the issue of police reform, it’s likely that efforts have ended to pass federal legislation on the matter, despite a nationwide movement.

Trudeau gave a similar response when the people starting chanting: “Black lives matter.” He did not speak and left as others began leaving Parliament Hill to start marching through the capital. Trudeau declined to say on Friday morning whether he would be present at the rally.

Speaking as police deployed tear gas on protesters just outside the White House, Trump vowed harsher action against protesters. The president made no mention of violent actions taken by police in recent days against protesters, nor did he make any call for national unity. Instead, he said he would mobilize “all available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights.” He specifically called on governors across the country to deploy the National Guard and vowed to deploy the U.S. military if states refused to comply. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. Activating the military would require Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy active-duty military on U.S. soil. The statute was last used during the 1992 uprising in Los Angeles over the acquittals of police officers involved in the brutal beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist. Protesters were peacefully gathered outside the White House even as Trump began speaking. Authorities, however, fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades in an attempt to move them away from the area before the president’s address began. We can hear the explosions from the streets as Trump is speaking in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/yRporcjN0T Here's the moment where police fired teargas into a crowd of peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park, just minutes before Trump's address in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/KPjxMKdDyx The public areas around the White House, particularly Lafayette Square, have been host to demonstrations for four days. On Sunday night, peaceful gatherings turned violent as police clashed with some protesters and several nearby buildings were vandalized or burned. Calling himself “your law-and-order president,” Trump pledged to escalate efforts to clamp down on the protests in Washington. “As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,” Trump said. As his remarks ended, Trump said he was leaving to go pay his respects “to a very, very special place.” He later walked through Lafayette Park, which had minutes earlier been filled with demonstrators, on his way to St. John’s Church, where he posed for a photo while holding up a Bible and then left. Trump holds up a bible, literally shushes reporters trying to ask him about his threat to use the military against citizens, poses for a photo, and leaves. pic.twitter.com/w2lPWWjMKu The president’s remarks came amid nationwide protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of American cities demanding justice for Floyd and other Black victims of police brutality. In many of those cities, police have deployed violent tactics to attempt to quell demonstrations, including firing rubber bullets and tear gas, pepper-spraying crowds and hitting people with batons. Trump has been at odds with several governors as protests over Floyd’s death have spread across the nation. In a call on Monday, he said state leaders were “weak,” urging them to arrest demonstrators and “put them in jail for 10 years.” “You have to dominate. If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time,” the president said during the call. “They’re going to run over you. You’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.” The language built on Trump’s vocal denouncements of demonstrators as “thugs.” In a widely criticized missive on Twitter, the president threatened violent intervention and said he would send in the National Guard should protests continue. “Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said of the rising protests in Minneapolis at the time. Twitter quickly appended a note to the tweet, saying it violated rules about glorifying violence. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5335,https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/bailey-duran/blm-protests-spark-calls-dixie-chicks-change-their-name,BLM Protests Spark calls for Dixie Chicks to Change Their Name,"Following weeks of protests about police brutality and racism, many activists have begun calling out the band Dixie Chicks to change their name, claiming the word “Dixie” harbors “the epitome of white America.” The Dixie Chicks, a band composed of Natalie Maines and twin sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer, is a country band that was started in 1989. The Chicks soared to popularity until a comment by Maines about President George W. Bush in 2003 sent their career on a downward spiral from which it never fully recovered. In London for a concert, Maines told the crowd in 2003, “We’re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.” They were instantly dropped from multiple country radio stations and boycotted by most of their fans. With the announcement of a comeback album called “Gaslighter,” slated to release in July 2020, the band was asked about changing its name because of the alleged racial connotations tied to it. According to dictionary.com, the word “dixie” describes “the southern states of the United States, especially those that were formerly part of the Confederacy.” The origin of the word “dixie” being used to describe the southern states is unknown, but some believe it could have been after Jeremiah Dixon, one of the men who established the Mason-Dixon Line, or after “dix” which was the name of a Louisiana $10 bill before the Civil War. Other theories are that it could have come about due to the song “Dixie” that was written by Daniel Decatur Emmett in 1859, or that a slave owner named “Dix” was so kind to his slaves that when they left, they had fond memories of living in “Dixie’s Land.” Variety has a different approach, saying that dixie is “the epitome of white America, a celebration of a Southern tradition that is invisible from Black Slaves and those grand plantations where they were forced to toil for free.” As of this writing, the Dixie Chicks have not released a statement regarding their name. The Chicks are not the only band that has been pressured to make a name change. Popular country band and five-time Grammy award winners Lady Antebellum recently changed their name to Lady A because of the meaning of “antebellum.” The band, comprised of Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott and Dave Haywood, posted a statement on its Instagram page. It partly reads, “We feel like we have been Awakened, but this is just one step. There are countless more that need to be taken. We want to do better. We are committed to examining our individual and collective impact and making the necessary changes to practice antiracism.” The word “antebellum” is Latin and means “before the war.” While it seems vague, many agree that it is referring to the Civil War specifically. While the band’s name change was met with some praise, not everyone was happy. Rogan O’Handley, a lawyer and journalist, tweeted, “I would love to say I’m now boycotting Lady Antebellum b/c of their cowardice, but I never liked their music anyway.” “Love your music. Now it is tainted to me forever. How easy it is to follow the sheep,” one fan said. Another fan responded to the news, “Yep I’m out. You just don’t have what it takes. You took a knee and bowed under pressure.” Copyright 1998-2021 CNSNews.com. CNSNews.com is a division of the Media Research Center.

5348,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/trumps-false-statements-about-how-democratic-leaders-handled-protests/,Trump's False Statements About How Democratic Leaders Handled Protests - FactCheck.org,"By Rem Rieder and D'Angelo Gore Posted on June 1, 2020 President Donald Trump has made false statements and implications about how three Democratic officials responded to violent protests that followed George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis: The inaccuracies come as the president has scolded state and local officials, often singling out Democrats, for not being tough enough in dealing with protests. In a conference call June 1, Trump told the nation’s governors they were “weak” and said they needed to act more aggressively in quelling violent behavior. The president, in a series of tweets May 30, praised the Secret Service for its work protecting the White House as an unruly crowd of more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the White House early that morning. At the same time, Trump charged that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser wouldn’t let the D.C police help protect him. Trump, May 30: On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice! But the D.C. police were involved in the protection during the tumultuous protest, as this Washington Post article makes clear. “Bowser and D.C. police Chief Peter Newsham said city police had in fact joined with Secret Service and U.S. Park Police on Saturday to control the demonstrators on Pennsylvania Avenue, even supplying the Secret Service with extra protective gear,” the article says. The Post also said its reporters covering the protests saw that D.C. Police were there. And the Secret Service said in a statement about the episode, “The Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.” Trump also was off-base on May 31 when he tweeted that Philadelphia officials should call in the National Guard to help deal with widespread looting in the city, suggesting their failure to do so reflected a general weakness in the way Democrats dealt with civil unrest. But the guard had been called in hours before Trump’s 4 p.m. tweet. Trump, May 31 tweet: Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. The guard was already on the way. At a noon press conference of city officials that day, Philadelphia Police Chief Danielle Outlaw said, “We have requested support from the Pennsylvania National Guard.” At a 6 p.m. press conference, Philadelphia Managing Director Brian Abernathy reiterated that the National Guard was en route and was expected later that night. He said the guard’s role would be to support the local police and act as a “force multiplier.” National Guard troops began arriving in Center City Philadelphia around 1 a.m. June 1 and were on patrol by dawn. Trump also suggested — falsely — that members of Minnesota’s National Guard didn’t arrive in Minneapolis to assist local and state law enforcement control crowds until the evening of May 30. “Congratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night,” Trump tweeted May 31. “The ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!” At least some Minnesota National Guard soldiers and airmen had been deployed to Minneapolis for duty the night of May 28. Early that day, after a second day of demonstrations in Minneapolis over Floyd’s death became increasingly violent, including looting, fires being set and a fatal shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey officially declared a local emergency and called for the state’s National Guard to be deployed to his city. (Frey’s office told us he actually asked for that help May 27, as the Star-Tribune reported.) But it was up to Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, to authorize the activation of the state’s National Guard, which he did by signing an executive order the afternoon of May 28. (At a roundtable discussion with business executives May 29, Trump left the inaccurate impression that he had called in National Guard troops to Minneapolis, saying “we brought in the National Guard today.”) After Walz signed the order, the Minnesota National Guard tweeted late on May 28 that it had “activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities.” It’s true that Walz called for a fuller mobilization of the guard’s soldiers and airmen on May 30. In a tweet late that day, the Minnesota National Guard said, “We now have more than 4,100 — quickly moving toward 10,800 — Minnesota Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen supporting our friends and neighbors in the Twin Cities.” That was “a significant increase over the 700 on-duty” as of May 29, the tweet said. A public affairs official for the guard told us that about 7,000 members had been deployed as of June 1. Editor’s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Taylor, who knows Boyd, said the rising young activist was injured by police. Boyd was filming the encounter, in which she argued with officers away from the Columbus statue. At the end of her recording, her phone appears to be knocked away. A second video, posted to Twitter from someone filming across the street, shows an officer wearing shorts and a bike helmet swinging his left hand at her. She flees after he swings. .@chicagosmayor we now have the video of Miracle being sucker punched by CPD! They don’t keep us safe! While they’re attacking a 2020 CPS graduates downtown, children were being shot tonight! A pregnant Womxn was shot & a 14 & 15y/o! You need to #DefundCPD now! pic.twitter.com/gYT4CL5HJ9 Ald. Taylor said watching video of the attack horrified her. Taylor’s daughter is good friends with Boyd. “I’m going to tell you right now, if this was my kid — and Miracle is one of mine — I would burn this city to the ground,” Taylor said. “You beat people up over a statue? You rough them up over a statue? “They’re so busy protecting white supremacy, they’re so busy protecting a Christopher Columbus statue that they beat her.” On Sunday, Boyd told Block Club she had been trying to assist a protester she saw being arrested when two officers approached her, one with dark gray facial hair and sunglasses. “He walked up to me and smacked me,” Boyd said Sunday. “I don’t know if the phone hit me in the mouth, I don’t know if his hand hit me in the mouth. “But the way that I was recording, I think that he tried to smack the phone in my hand and he hit me at the same time, and the phone hit me in the mouth, and it knocked my tooth out and I was bleeding.” RELATED: Protesters Try To Tear Down Columbus Statue In Chicago As Clashes Between Police, Activists Turn Violent GoodKids MadCity tweeted in the aftermath, showing Boyd suffered multiple injuries to her face and chipped teeth. They later tweeted the video footage they said showed a police officer beating Boyd in the face. Essence Gatheright, a 16-year-old member of Chicago Freedom School‘s youth leadership board who was at the protest, said Boyd spoke at the rally earlier that night. Gatheright helped get Boyd get medical attention at the Freedom School after she was hit. “Her teeth came out, it was really bad,” Gatheright said. “She was bleeding, she kept crying and sobbing. It was a really messed up situation. … We were able to walk her and others to the school and provide her with support and make sure she got home safely.” Ald. Taylor said Boyd is “a good kid, a CPS graduate” who has helped raise money for the most vulnerable in her community. “I don’t care if you become the president, the mayor, the garbage man — you are not exempt from this country and what its racist ass will do to you,” Taylor said. Through tears, Taylor said she was tired. “How many more times are we going to go through this?” State Sen. Robert Peters posted the photo of Boyd’s injuries, saying he had just offered her an internship last week because she is “fighting gun violence everyday.” “She is just over 5 ft, 100 pounds. Tonight a police officer beat her. Knocked out her teeth,” Peters tweeted. “I’m sad, angry, and disgusted.” Kofi Ademola, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Chicago, also tweeted about the case Friday, saying “Don’t let the Mayor or city Council sleep until we get the justice we demand!” Boyd is a recent graduate of Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy in Ashburn. “Only you can determine where life takes you.”@GoodeSTEM graduate Miracle Boyd is headed to @DePaulU next to study accounting – congratulations! #BetterMakeRoomChicago pic.twitter.com/KpQjP9UaPE Last weekend, she helped lead a protest through Washington Park and Woodlawn in memory of friends lost to violence. She said more policing is not the answer and demanded that Mayor Lori Lightfoot divest from the Chicago Police Department and direct the money to communities instead. “We’re the people of the community. I don’t see you [Mayor Lightfoot] out here organizing people,” Boyd said. “… We are the ones in our community that have to deal with the trauma.” She was recently featured in a Block Club Chicago story about the Washington Park protest. She also co-wrote a story about activism in Injustice Watch. Friday evening’s protest ended in in clashes between police and demonstrators, some of whom attempted to pull down the statute of Christopher Columbus in the southern edge of the park. Police eventually converged on the area, using pepper spray to push back protesters. Video tweeted from reporters and demonstrators shows multiple physical confrontation. In a statement, the Chicago Police News Affairs office said it was not aware of the Boyd incident. “The Chicago Police Department strives to treat all individuals our officers encounter with respect,” according to the statement. “We do not tolerate misconduct of any kind and if any wrongdoing is discovered, officers will be held accountable. Anyone who feels they have been mistreated by a CPD officer is encouraged to call 311 and file a complaint with COPA, who will investigate allegations of misconduct.” During the protest last week in Washington Park, Boyd and other activists detailed proposals about reducing violence in their communities, calling on the city to reallocate 2 percent of the Chicago police budget to services like robust mental health, schools and grocery stores. That money would help support violence interrupters and other residents doing ground-level work to keep communities safe through direct action with gang members. Peace treaties, accountability, trauma-healing and a restorative justice process are all part of the plan, Boyd said. You can donate to help Boyd with needed medical care here.

ATLANTA — Protesters caused extensive damage to the Georgia State Patrol headquarters in Atlanta early Sunday by sparking flames inside the building with fireworks, breaking windows and spraying graffiti, the agency said. Department of Public Safety workers put out the fire, and two employees were treated for smoke inhalation, Georgia State Patrol Lt. Stephanie Stallings said in a statement. One of the agency’s vehicles parked in front of the building was also damaged. Video showed several dozen people outside and the sound of drums being played in the background. Smoke could be seen through a glass window of the building after a red flash was seen inside. TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure billMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestream As many as 100 people dressed in dark clothing and wearing masks were outside the building, Stallings said. The incident was under investigation and no arrests had been made, the statement said. The demonstration started peacefully, said Kimberly Krautter, who recorded video of the fire. “Only about three or four people” looked to be trying to vandalize the building, she said. Protests have taken place in Atlanta over the past month in response to the deaths of Rayshard Brooks and George Floyd, but the subject of this protest wasn’t clear, Krautter said. The building is located about 3 miles (5 kilometers) southeast of downtown. It also houses a number of other state agencies, news outlets reported.  Copyright © 2021 The Washington Times, LLC.

5580,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/345399-deputize-gun-owners-clay/,Florida Sheriff floats deputizing all gun owners in county to battle protests,"A Northeast Florida Sheriff facing a competitive primary used department resources to make a self-promotional video this week under the guise of combatting civil unrest. The message to would-be protesters: “You’ve been warned.” (The message to political opponents, meanwhile, is one of the power and prerogatives of incumbency, especially in a crowded field of candidates.) Clay County Sheriff Darryl Daniels released Tuesday a red meat video vowing to, if needed, deputize gun owners in the event Black Lives Matter protesters came into the county. “Somebody has to step up in front of the camera and say ‘enough is enough,'” said Daniels, vowing that “if we can’t handle you …. I’ll make special deputies of every lawful gun owner in this county.” The warning (not a “threat,” Daniels says repeatedly), is especially interesting, given that Camp Blanding, from which the National Guard could deploy as it did during riots in actual cities, is in the county. The three-minute video is full of the kind of bluster that traditionally plays well in Clay. “If you threaten to come to Clay County and think for one second we’ll bend our backs for you, you’re sadly mistaken,” Daniels said. “You can threaten all you want, you can say ‘let’s go to Clay County’,” but “you’ll have something waiting for you you don’t want,” he added. “The second you step out from under the protection of the Constitution, we’ll be waiting for you, and you’ll have everything you want. All the publicity, all the pain, all the glamour and glory, for all that five minutes will give you,” Daniels promised, in a video that plays up contrasts between Clay County and urban areas, with a little flash for Fox News should they pick it up. “God is absent from the media’s message or Black Lives Matter or any other group out there that’s making themselves a spectacle,” Daniels theorized. Wherever God is or isn’t, Daniels himself picked up earned media at the right time, running fourth in the money race for the August primary. Daniels, who has $38,514 on hand, trails opponents Ben Carroll, Michelle Cook, and Mike Taylor. Cook said Daniels was acting like a “reality show sheriff” and called the video a “political scam.” However, in a seven-way race, the ability to leverage the public resources with the needs of a corporate media starved for any content that affirms the social order has a value that won’t show up in campaign finance, but could show up in October. Despite an FDLE investigation dating to last summer, polling this spring showed Daniels well positioned in August, with strong approval numbers. This video probably won’t hurt those numbers. A.G. Gancarski has been a correspondent for FloridaPolitics.com since 2014. In 2018, he was a finalist for an Association of Alternative Newsweeklies ""best political column."" He can be reached at [email protected] July 1, 2020 at 9:12 am What could possibly go wrong? July 1, 2020 at 10:16 am So help me God, the sheriff’s speech is a threat. Deputizing every lawful gun owner is not good law enforcement… too many folks with guns are looking to hurt the protesters. Their excuse for shooting at protesters will be stand your ground (when a protester spray paints confederate monument) July 1, 2020 at 11:56 am legitimate protestors do not spray paint or destroy property. rioters and looters do those things. legitimate peaceful protestors have nothing to worry about. rioters and looters have been warned. good for the sheriff. we need more like him in this country! July 1, 2020 at 2:02 pm If they come to my home, my kids, my families and want to do harm.. no that is NOT OKAY.. What have they done for their country except to destroy innocent peoples livelihood. Come my way, go out my way July 1, 2020 at 8:03 pm IF those of US with guns were looking to hurt PROTESTORS, they would all be hurt by now. It’s NOT us you need to fear. The sheriff is speaking about the LOOTERS breaking into homes and businesses. Pull your head out of your ass. July 1, 2020 at 8:11 pm Don’t break the law and you have nothing to worry about. July 2, 2020 at 12:30 pm All citizens have the right to defense of person and property..rioting law breakers surrender their rights..much like a liquor store bandits…those rights end immediately… July 1, 2020 at 9:56 am Distraction that the sheriff screws around on his wife. He ain’t no roughy. Him is a married man fornicating with other women! Clay County defund this sheriff ! His pc is bs! July 1, 2020 at 11:21 am What no free gas cards? Play to your base. Watchout for all those protestors coming to Middleburg! Who wants to protest in the middle of nowhere?? How much time & money was spent on this propaganda? Darryl should be fired for fraud,waste, & abuse. If we had a real guv he would’ve been gone a long time ago. July 1, 2020 at 11:48 am When does someone “step out from under the protection of the Constitution”? NEVER. Moronic, ignorant thug. Even if and when you break the law you are STILL under the protection of the Constitution, you idiot. July 1, 2020 at 8:48 pm My comment, exactly! The Constitution covers the whole United States, even Clay County, FL. July 3, 2020 at 12:12 am huh? he said he is protecting the constitution not stepping out from it. sheesh you people already twisting words July 1, 2020 at 12:02 pm This man is an utter disgrace. Of course, the fact that he feels comfortable indulging in such barbaric campaign speech is itself a reflection of the mindset of the plurality of voters he’s pandering to. Has he forgotten about his adulterous comings and goings with a former JSO corrections officer that he seemingly had arrested under false pretenses to cover up his dirty tracks? Some voters surely haven’t forgotten. A pitiful joke, he is. Its time for Clay to elect a new sheriff. July 1, 2020 at 12:15 pm the mindset of the plurality of voters he’s pandering to.” Oh, those of us who wish to protect our families and property from LAWLESS rioters and looters? THAT “plurality of voters”? If so you can kiss my you know what! Who the H3LL are YOU to tell me that I can not protect myself, my family, my property, and the public property that my tax dollars help maintain! YOU madam can take a long walk off a short pier! July 1, 2020 at 12:12 pm I loved the video! He is stating what is needed in this country! Tearing up businesses, destroying historical monuments, attacking police and civilians is a felony and should be treated as such! I would proudly stand with our sheriffs and police as a lawful gun owner! I would gladly serve and protect our America. You sir, are on the wrong side! Your journalism is part of the problem! You should be fired. July 1, 2020 at 12:21 pm EXACTLY! These liberals are so dense they have blurred the lines between legitimate peaceful protestors and rioters and looters! To think that rioters and looters have the same Constitutional right to destroy property and harm citizens is INSANE! No one, NO ONE is going to stop ME from protecting myself, my family, my property, and the public property that my tax dollars support! NO ONE! July 2, 2020 at 9:27 pm Amen July 1, 2020 at 12:32 pm Bunch of cry babies in these comments. Stay out, stay away or else. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Fair warning. Enough is enough. Don’t like it, tough. July 1, 2020 at 12:41 pm “cry babies ” – Feel good, indoctrinated Liberals. The Communists used to ( probably still do) call them USEFUL IDIOTS. July 1, 2020 at 1:44 pm Well the first paragraph of this article certainly makes it clear which side the author is on. I am so sick and tired of the gd media and their support of the lawless and violent rioters, looters, and vandals that are desecrating monuments, destroying businesses and private property in our cities. I say hooray for this sheriff and if I was in Clay I would gladly volunteer to become a deputy in his service. As is it I am ready and waiting for these maggots to come to my neck of the woods. Got my Mossberg 12 gauge pump and 100 rounds of ammo ready and waiting. Bring it scumbags! July 1, 2020 at 1:47 pm Good for the residents of Clay county. July 1, 2020 at 1:50 pm boy bye… July 1, 2020 at 3:00 pm What and idiot! Deputies any and everybody with a gun. That makes perfect sense. We see what happens when trained people are given a weapon a and badge. What could possible go wrong with a bunch of hyped up hot heads walking around with guns ready to shoot. July 1, 2020 at 3:27 pm Would you rather the sheriff sit back and let the rioters and looters come in and burn down businesses and let them beat and kill the people that lives there?or shoot the police officers that are trying to protect us? I guess I’m one of them hyped up hotheads cause I will shoot anyone that tries to harm my family or property! What would you do if they came after you and your family?? July 1, 2020 at 4:03 pm What “AND” idiot? You must be talking to yourself. Deputize <— not Deputies Also if you paid any attention to the video, he said he would deputize every ""LAWFUL GUN OWNER"" in the county. One other thing, please take note, this is a duly elected BLACK man speaking out against the terrorist organization BLM. More power to him. July 1, 2020 at 3:57 pm AMEN!!!!! That’s how things get back in order. Way to go Sheriff. July 1, 2020 at 4:22 pm About time a politician took steps to protect the voting public, as opposed to pandering to looters and rioters. He stated that he might deputize “lawful gun owning citizens”. I would guess he is referencing gun owning concealed carry permit holders. Those same honest citizens whose finger prints, photo and background checks have been performed. Of course the ultra liberal snowflakes oppose this. That is until they are threatened… July 1, 2020 at 4:44 pm Not from Clay county, but definitely armed and will defend our property. Good for this sheriff – we have enough thugs and punks without opening the door to rioters, looters and Soros hired disrupters. People need to wake up. July 1, 2020 at 9:13 pm Amen! I want to move to Clay County. I admire the sheriff’s thinking. Enough lawlessness! July 1, 2020 at 6:32 pm Wow…I see a few leftists have found their way here. I guess it can’t be helped as the writer of this article is one of them. These “Urnalists” have enabled outright terrorism in our communities when they conflate peaceful protesters with rioters. His goal is to indoctrinate and activate the leftists. They need economic upheaval in order to beat Trump…and that’s when the fun really begins. The true goal is to eliminate the Electoral College so States like New York and California dictate who runs the country. The key players never get caught as there are useful idiots that will do their job for them. Have you ever noticed Antifa leading a pack of rioters only for them to disappear when the police show up? That of course brings us to the crux of the problem here…Protecting your homes, family, and neighbors are simply unacceptable to them. These are the same people not 6 months ago were screaming for you to disarm. First it was we just want the AR-15’s…then they wanted all “assault rifles,” and finally they claimed everyone’s semiautomatic weapons was their true target. Any real gun owner will tell you that 95% of all firearms in the US are semiautomatic. Then the so called “peaceful protests” broke out. Seattle was having their very own Woodstock love in. Accept that’s not exactly how it went down is it leftists? You had the warlord of Chaz (never call it Chop) handing out AR-15’s to drug addicts, felons, and 14 year old children (it’s been recorded). Where oh where were the anti-gun nuts when all of this was happening? That’s right, they were fueling the defund the police movement. You leftists have crossed a line you will never return from. We know what you’re trying to do and we see everyone of your cities collapse before our very eyes. We know that you’re nothing more than social vampires bleeding this nation of its resources. Too those in Clay County….do you honestly think they won’t come for you? At current the leftists are attempting to push into every conservative run city, county, and municipality. It’s only a matter of time before they make a stop in your town. Addendum- “Assult rifle” is a made up buzzword from the Clinton era. The “protesters” are anything but peaceful. Too those that watch the mass media today…they’re all lying to you. If you want the real truth seek independent media. Tim Pool on YouTube is a great place to start. Watch his coverage and you will see the truth. July 1, 2020 at 8:07 pm OY. July 1, 2020 at 11:38 pm “OY”.. Oh Yeah! You bet your sweet *** if LOOTERS and RIOTERS come on MY property they WILL be dealt with accordingly. … Now, PEACEFUL protestors, that’s a different story. I’ll be out there handing them juice boxes and giving them hugs. July 2, 2020 at 7:41 am Didn’t realize the Sheriff could mobilize the National Guard! Whoops, I mistook this article for journalism. July 2, 2020 at 12:40 pm “They are just freedom fighters it’s ok” just like Seattle you want a group to take over 6 city blocks and in those city blocks they’ve raped women killed kids beaten people up. Is that what you liberals want? Come to Florida the gunshine state and try that shit here… you’ve been warned July 2, 2020 at 1:03 pm Wow you really took down my post? This web page must be run by liberals. Unbelievable. There goes freedom of speech. It’s ok to bash the sheriff call him a cheater, an idiot claim he’s a fraud but if some one calls out the so called freedom fighters of Seattle the comment gets deleted. Come down to FLAWDA and get ya some! July 3, 2020 at 12:07 am So more untrained cops on the streets. sounds legit. “I see dead people” July 3, 2020 at 1:45 pm I see a liberal scared Comments are closed.

A group of women who call themselves the Wall of Moms has drawn national attention, clad in bike helmets and goggles. They link arms to form a protective barrier between law enforcement and Black Lives Matter protesters who took to the streets after the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. In a recent moment captured on video, a large crowd of the yellow-garbed women sing as if a lullaby, ""Hands up, please don't shoot me."" Moms sing lullaby “hands up please don’t shoot me” pic.twitter.com/GJhj8ymn12 Members of the Wall of Moms say they follow the directions of Black leaders, and that their driving vision is that ""we moms would take some physical hits in hopes our Black and Brown kids, friends, neighbors, and loved ones will be spared some pain."" In another video, also taken by freelance journalist Sergio Olmos, a protester uses a hockey stick to push back a canister of tear gas. Another uses a leaf blower to blow back the gas, a tactic used last year by protesters in Hong Kong. A protester uses a hockey stick to swing tear gas canister back, another uses a leaf blower pic.twitter.com/GSdFeErinC State and local leaders have repeatedly called for federal agents to leave the city, arguing that their presence has made an already-tense environment worse. ""The federal police have their marching orders on how they're going to do things,"" Portland Police Association President Daryl Turner told NPR on Tuesday. ""And that coordination was not made with Portland police."" In response to both the federal actions in Portland and the implied threat by President Trump to deploy federal officers to other U.S. cities, more than a dozen U.S. mayors have sent an open letter to Attorney General William Barr and Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The letter calls on the Department of Justice and DHS to withdraw the forces from American cities and halt plans to send any more. ""Deployment of federal forces in the streets of our communities has not been requested nor is it acceptable. While U.S. Marshals have had jurisdiction inside federal courthouses for decades, it is unacceptable and chilling that this administration has formed and deployed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Rapid Deployment Unit and is sending federal authorities to conduct crowd control on city streets and detain individuals,"" the mayors write. They point to the federal officers' use of less-lethal munitions against protesters that have caused serious injury and to the grabbing of people off the street and pulling them into unmarked vehicles. ""These are tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes – not our democracy,"" the mayors write. On Tuesday, Wolf said, ""Portland is unique,"" arguing that local officials and police hadn't done enough to control what he said was violence stemming from the nightly protests, and saying those protests increasingly threaten federal buildings downtown. Asked about Trump's threat to send federal officers into other cities, Wolf said reporters could ""ask the White House."" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said the situation in Portland had been starting to calm before federal forces arrived. ""The harsh reality is, this is about scoring political points with [Trump's] base,"" Brown told PBS NewsHour on Monday. ""This is about political theater. If they were really interested in problem-solving or in public safety, they would be willing to de-escalate and engage in dialogue."" She added, ""Instead, they bring more troops to the streets. They take peaceful protesters off into unmarked cars. And, unfortunately, last weekend, they almost killed a peaceful protester. This is absolutely outrageous. It is a violation of the principles on which this country was founded."" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5649,https://www.the-sun.com/news/1135323/churches-burned-black-lives-matter-protests/,Multiple churches ‘burned and vandalized’ across US as cops investigate possible links to statue protests,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. A NUMBER of Catholic churches have been torched and vandalized in the US as cops investigate whether this is linked to the ongoing statue protests. Houses of worship are being burned after George Floyd's police custody death in Minneapolis on May 25, which sparked widespread outrage and anti-racism rallies. Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King urged demonstrators to ""tear"" down Jesus Christ statues and murals because he said they are ""a form of white supremacy"" on Twitter. While Confederate monuments are being taken down all over the country, Christian statues are reportedly being vandalized and churches have been set on fire. In the city of Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Mission, a 249-year-old Catholic church, was engulfed in flames in the early hours of Saturday morning. CNN reported that firefighters and emergency responders fought the blaze for three hours as the ancient ceiling and roof began to cave in. The church was preparing to mark its upcoming 250th anniversary celebration before the alleged arson attack, causing severe water and smoke damage. It came under criticism because of the surrounding statues of St Junipero Serra, which have been toppled by BLM protesters in other areas. Critics say the 18th-century Franciscan priest was complicit in an imperial conquest that oppressed Native Americans. ""One of the factors investigators are taking into account is the recent vandalism to the statues of the saint, specifically in the Los Angeles region,"" San Gabriel Fire Department fire captain Antonio Negrete said. “This will be another box that they’re going to check off,” he told Fox11. ""It's a tragic loss for our city. It's our city identifier."" Elsewhere, in San Diego, the police department’s Metro Arson Strike Team are investigating a ""suspicious"" 12.30 pm blaze at Calvary Baptist church on Sunday. Although it's a historically Black church, it has become a “multi-cultural faith community,"" as per its website. Around the same time as the LA blaze, a man in Florida mowed his vehicle into the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala ahead of morning Mass on Saturday. Steven Anthony Shields, 24, from Dunnellon allegedly poured gasoline in the foyer, set the building on fire, and drove off, as per the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was arrested and charged with attempted murder, arson, burglary, and evading arrest. Shields described the incident as ""awesome,"" saying he was on a ""mission"" as he smiled and laughed, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Ocala Star-Banner. He cited issues with the Catholic Church but Shields also reportedly has schizophrenia and isn't taking his medication. Nevertheless, Mass was celebrated Saturday and Sunday, local outlets said, despite the damage to the foyer. Elsewhere, Missouri authorities are looking into a suspected arson attack in Johnson County, where a 100-year-old church went up in flames. Harmony Baptist Church was burned to the ground at 11.22 pm on July 5, according to Johnson County Fire Protection District. It took over two hours for firefighters from four stations and 50,000 gallons of water to get a handle on the raging blaze, which caused between $400,000 and $500,000 of damage. Security camera footage shows the arson suspect parking outside and then entering the building before setting the building alight, local reports said. “The loss of the historic church will have a lasting effect on the rural community and members of the church,"" Fire Chief Larry Jennings told The Sun. ""It will take a community effort to identify those responsible for the fire and to help the congregation as they move forward.” It isn't known if this arson attack is connected with the ongoing protests and Jennings said there is no current evidence to suggest it is related as the probe continues. But it's not just churches that are going up in flames. In Massachusetts, cops are investigating a suspected arson attack on a statue of the Virgin Mary on Saturday night. Catholic News Agency reported that the statue is located outside St Peter’s Parish in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood. Police responded to a fire on Bowdin Street at around 10 pm on July 11. The statue of Mary sustained heavy damage after an unknown individual set fire to the plastic flower's in the statue's hands. This caused smoke and flame damage to the face, head, and upper body of the statue. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Boston described the unknown culprit as ""a troubled soul."" ""Boston Fire Department has just begun its investigation, so we don’t have a sense what was the reason behind this action,"" Terrence C. Donilon, their Secretary for Communications & Public Affairs, told The Sun. ""That said, whoever is responsible for the desecration of the Holy Mother’s statue is clearly a troubled soul. ""Mary represents all that is good and pure in our world. We have confidence in local law enforcement to investigate this matter. We pray for the person or persons responsible."" Another Blessed Virgin Mary statue outside Cathedral Prep School and Seminary in New York City was desecrated on July 10 with the word “IDOL."" The NYPD confirmed that they are investigating the vandalization of the statue, which occurred shortly after 3am on Friday, July 10. On the security footage, someone can be seen approaching the 100-year-old statue and spray painting the word across it, before fleeing the scene. The NYPD have appealed to the public for help in identifying the culprit of this ""criminal mischief incident."" Rector and president of Cathedral Prep Fr James Kuroly told The Sun this vandalism was “an act of hatred"" on Tuesday. ""I don't think there's a connection per say [with the protests] like it's organized,"" he said. ""I do think it's where we are as a society and as a country where there has been so much division and so much focus on what separates us and when we focus on that division, it leads to ignorance and it leads to acts of hatred. ""It really does symbolize the state of affairs that we are in right now as a society,"" he added. ""There has certainly been an outpouring of support [from the local community]."" Anyone with information about the spray painted statue should call the Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782), submit their tips on their website, on Twitter @NYPDTips, or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.

(AP) — A Florida sheriff says he will deputize every gun owner in his county to put down violent protests his deputies can’t handle alone. Clay County Sheriff Darryl Daniels gave no indication in a three-minute video (which you can see, above) released Wednesday that any demonstrations are planned in his suburban Jacksonville county. Still, he said if anyone starts “tearing up Clay County,” he would deputize gun owners if needed. Daniels said his office has a “great relationship” with the community.

About a week after Gov. Tim Walz wrote to President Trump requesting federal aid to repair widespread damage in Minneapolis and St. Paul from the fiery George Floyd protests, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rebuffed the request for a financial helping hand. The state has estimated total damages at more than $500 million, and Walz specifically wrote in his July 2 letter that $15 million in cleanup and repair costs could be eligible for federal reimbursement. “The governor is disappointed that the federal government declined his request for financial support ... to help Minnesota rebuild after civil unrest damaged public infrastructure and caused extensive fire damage in the wake of George Floyd’s death,” spokesman Teddy Tschann said in a statement. “As we navigate one of the most difficult periods in our state’s history, we look for support from our federal government to help us through,” he said. Hundreds of buildings in the Twin Cities were destroyed by fires, looted or damaged during the nightly protests following Floyd’s May 25 death beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis cop. A local police precinct was among the structures torched during the demonstrations. Walz noted in his letter that it was “the second most destructive incident of civil unrest in United States history after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.” The governor noted the state budget was further crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an anticipated $1.5 billion surplus morphing into a projected deficit of $2.4 billion. FEMA, in a statement provided to Minnesota Public Radio, said the turndown came after a “thorough review” of the state’s request for the funds as a major disaster area. “It was determined that the impact to public infrastructure is within the capabilities of the local and state governments to recover from,” the statement concluded. Minnesota officials now have 30 days to appeal the federal rejection, with the governor’s spokesman saying his office was “exploring more options” to resolve its dire financial situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The event in The Domain, which almost 5000 people had registered on Facebook to attend, came to nothing as NSW Police ordered protesters to disperse, 15 minutes before it was scheduled to begin at midday on Tuesday. See police shut the protest down in the video above Hundreds of police were on duty at the park and six arrests were made. Of the six, five were fined $1000 each and a sixth person, a 25-year-old woman, was issued a criminal infringement notice for offensive language. Organiser Paddy Gibson was one of those arrested and said supporters were asked to gather in groups of fewer than 20 after they failed on Monday to overturn a NSW Supreme Court decision prohibiting the protest. Gibson said organisers directed protesters to leave peacefully and without confronting police after being told mass arrests would otherwise occur. He said he’d been told by police that despite The Domain’s size, only 20 people would be permitted in the park. “We weren’t allowed to give it a run even though Westfield is allowed, as well as the casino and the NRL,” the 37 year old said. “People are allowed to come together to make profits but they’re not allowed to come together to say black lives matter - that’s a disgraceful situation in NSW. “They don’t want to see us build unity, build power, demand accountability and demand justice from this government because it’s too politically sensitive.” Gibson said protesters would challenge any fines handed out. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Willing warned that protesters who intended to rally outside NSW parliament on Tuesday would be arrested. Justice Mark Ierace on Sunday accepted the police argument that the possibility of community transmission of COVID-19 arising from the Sydney rally made the event too risky. The appeal court, which will hand down its reasons soon, on Monday dismissed a challenge to Justice Ierace’s decision. Organisers previously said they would risk arrest and go ahead with the rally before delivering a 90,000-strong petition to NSW Parliament calling for justice for Indigenous man David Dungay Jr. Mr Dungay, aged 26 and a diabetic, died in December 2015 after five prison officers stormed his Sydney jail cell to stop him eating biscuits. Premier Gladys Berejiklian had earlier appealed to “people’s conscience and ethical standards” not to attend.

Virginia state officials ordered the removal of an American flag from the construction site in Richmond, citing concerns that the flag would become a ""target"" for protesters this Fourth of July. The call from the Department of General Services reportedly angered a subcontractor whose company created the flag using tarps in celebration of Independence Day. “When we saw the flag, we were concerned that it could become a target so we told the contractor to remove it,” department spokeswoman Dena Potter told The Washington Post in an email. ASTRONAUT DOUG HURLEY TWEETS PIC OF AMERICAN FLAG FROM INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION The officials pointed to the recent protests targeting historical statues and monuments that represent what demonstrators say are a part of systemic racism in the U.S. “Over the past month, we’ve seen buildings and structures around Capitol Square vandalized and flags, dumpsters, a bus and other items set ablaze during demonstrations around the city,” Potter said. The flag was reportedly as tall as one story in a building and was to be mounted on top of what is a $300 million project in the city. “Since when is this flag, on this weekend, IN THIS COUNTRY, a Target!!” Eric Winston from American Coatings Corp. wrote on Facebook. “Let me guess, if I had a black lives matter flag it would be 'ok'!? [sic]” SEN. TIM SCOTT: FOURTH OF JULY CHALLENGES – AS IN TIMES PAST WE WILL UNITE, PROGRESS AND HOPE, ALWAYS Winston said that the flag originally went up with the approval from Gilbane Building Company, the project's general manager. The company then received a call from state officials requesting they take it down. “The American Flag is a symbol of Freedom! Many men and women died to maintain this freedom, many more fought and still fight to keep this freedom, and you make us remove it??” “I'm all for the freedoms and liberty's [sic] we have in this country, Protest, sure. Take a knee during the national anthem, whatever floats your boat. Marry who you want, absolutely,” Winston added. “That's what this flag represents!” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Potter noted the city did not have any objections to the standard-size flag flying high on a crane but was worried the large flag was more accessible to protesters. “Of course the safety of the workers on the job and the public is our No. 1 concern, but we also did not want to see the flag damaged in any way,” Potter told The Post.

David Lapan.","'They need to be in their goddamn green-ass uniform and not in Army military camouflage.' By Jeff Schogol | Published Jul 25, 2020 2:02 PM You can be forgiven for thinking that U.S. troops have been dispatched to the streets of Washington, D.C., Portland, and other cities in recent weeks. The news has been rife with concerning videos and images of little green men kitted out with military gear as they confront – and sometimes beat – protesters, including at least one U.S. Naval Academy alumnus. var siteRootDomainParts = window.location.host.split("".""); var siteRootDomain = window.location.host; if ( siteRootDomainParts.length >= 2 ) { siteRootDomain = siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 2] + ""."" + siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 1]; } cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: ""3c020dea-a94e-40a8-be0a-8a3170cc7c1b"", customParam1: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId + """", customParam2: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + """", customParam3: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + """", settings: { advertising: { macros: { cust_params: ""site="" + siteRootDomain + ""&targeting_article="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.externalId + ""&targeting_section="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + ""&targeting_keyword="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + ""&article="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, article: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, category: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section, keywords: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords, } } } }).render(""404a5343b1434e25bf26b4e6356298bc""); }); But the U.S. government has not declared martial law. The people wearing military camouflage uniforms – and, in some cases, carrying M4 carbines – are from federal law enforcement agencies. They are border patrol officers, U.S. Marshals, and other civilian police officers. They are not U.S. service members, no matter how much they may resemble them. “When people who have served in the military for a long time have to look very hard at the photos and video from Portland and places like that to tell who these individuals [federal agents] are, then the average citizen is going to easily confuse what they see as a militarized response rather than a law enforcement one,” said retired Marine Col. David Lapan, a former spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of Homeland Security. Indeed, some media outlets have erroneously referred to federal officers as troops — and that misperception that the military has assumed a domestic law enforcement role is bad for democracy, according to Lapan “It creates the perception that the U.S. military is being used to suppress the American people.” Chad Wolf, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters on Wednesday that border patrol officers are wearing camouflage in Portland because that’s the uniform they wear when they are deployed to the southwestern border. “That is their everyday uniform and it is completely appropriate,” Wolf said at a news briefing. “They have insignia on their uniforms that read police and they have patches … that indicate which agency they are from.” Related: Stop what you're doing and watch this interview with the badass Navy vet who went viral in Portland Meanwhile, the U.S. Marshals in Portland who are wearing military uniforms belong to the agency’s Special Operations Group, said U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman Michelle Coghill. “SOG relies on established Department of Defense research to ensure the best economic value for taxpayers and a high level of protection for its personnel, and sometimes procures specialized equipment also used by U.S. military forces, including uniforms, helmets, gas masks and protective gear for tactical operations,” Coghill told Task & Purpose. The Defense Department doesn’t just provide equipment to the U.S. Marshals Service. Under the 1033 Program, the Defense Logistics Agency transfers a variety of excess military equipment to local police departments, including MRAP-All Terrain Vehicles. Related: A West Virginia town of 8,400 people just picked up an MRAP for some reason However, both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have stated that police should be distinguishable from U.S. service members so that the general public does not mistakenly think the military is performing law enforcement duties. The issue first arose during protests in Washington, D.C., in June after National Guardsmen and some federal authorities appeared in similar uniforms, Milley told the House Armed Services Committee recently. “You want a clear distinction – visually – visual distinction between that which is police and that which is military because when you start introducing [the] military, you’re talking a different level of effort there,” Milley said during the July 9 hearing. During the 15 years that I’ve had the honor to tell service members’ stories, I’ve learned that troops have no desire to serve as a national police force on American soil. As one crusty noncommissioned officer told me years ago, the military’s mission is “to go to where the terrorists live and f–k up their neighborhoods.” Still, active-duty troops have been used in response to civil unrest in the past, such as during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. It is also true that service members take an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies both foreign and domestic. If that’s the case, then why is it bad for democracy if Americans have a hard time distinguishing between domestic law enforcement agents and troops? One reason is that the public is generally not in favor of blurring the lines that separate the roles of police and the military, Lapan said. And while the Oath of Enlistment mentions domestic enemies, it was changed around the time of the Civil War because the Southern states had launched an insurrection. Related: Army grounds crew of helicopter that flew low over protests amid official investigation “I think the context of ‘domestic enemies’ lends itself more to the idea of someone that would try to overthrow the government,” Lapan said. “We’re talking about that type of activity, not protests – not even criminal activity.” Normally, U.S. troops are used for humanitarian missions inside the United States, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Lapan added. In fact, when Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré took command in New Orleans following the devastating 2005 hurricane, one of the first things he did was instill in every first responder that they were not in a war zone. “Put those damn weapons down,” Honoré barked at both troops and police officers alike. “I'm not going to tell you again, goddamn it! Get those goddamn weapons down!” Related: Meet the former soldier who gave National Guardsmen in DC an impromptu phalanx lesson in this viral video Now retired, Honoré was just as blunt when he told Task & Purpose that federal law enforcement officers have misappropriated military uniforms in order to look intimidating. “Law enforcement should not be wearing military uniforms,” Honoré said. “Military uniforms are designed to blend into the terrain and it’s a function of identifying our soldiers on the ground. The police need to stay in their lanes.” He also said he doesn’t buy Wolf’s explanation that the border patrol is just wearing their normal uniforms. “That’s bullshit,” Honoré said. “They need to be in their goddamn green-ass uniform and not in Army military camouflage.” “SWAT teams, sheriff’s office, border patrol, go get your own goddamned uniforms,” he said. “There’s nothing that a camouflage uniform can do for you in an urban operation other than [to] portray a sense of authority that you are big, you are bad, and you are armed.

Hundreds of Iowa teachers turned a parade into a protest of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ plan to send them and students back to school this year. The “Drive for Lives” parade of more than 500 cars drove from East High School to the Iowa Statehouse to send the message that going back to school is too dangerous. Reynolds’ plan mandates 50% face-to-face learning in Iowa schools during the pandemic. “We wanted to make sure we did this safely,” Des Moines teacher Tammy Bortscheller said. Bortscheller said she and other protestors school leaders to determine the safest “Return to Learn” models for their communities. “Teachers are very passionate people,” Bortscheller said. “We care for our students. We care for our colleagues. We care for our students’ families, and that shows just by the turnout that we've had here.” Some teachers called returning to school during the pandemic a life and death issue that Reynolds simply does not understand. Organizers said teachers will hold more protests if the governor does not listen to their concerns.

Ironically, the left-wing rioters didn’t seem to care that he had defended them in the past. ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship. Download Our Free Trump News App*** Check out what Fox News reported: Wheeler, who for weeks has been backing the protests against efforts by federal law enforcement to stop rioting near federal property, joined protesters at fencing near the Hatfield Courthouse and tried to conduct a “listening session” — and was even hit by tear gas deployed by federal agents. However, while some protesters were receptive to his presence, many others heckled and booed him, objecting to his refusal to back some of their demands such as abolishing the police, and for the Portland Police’s (for which he is a commissioner) use of tear gas and other methods to shut down riots. “F— Ted Wheeler,” yelled one protester. “He doesn’t get to speak, he’s a f—ing fascist. F— Ted Wheeler.” Later on, a chaotic crowd swarmed him, calling him a “f—ing a–hole” while other shouted, “Tear gas Ted has got to go.” After he refused to abolish the police force, the angry crowd got riled up and even threatened to visit his home. “F-ck you,” “get the f-ck out” they yelled, adding, “your house next.” ***FREE ‘Keep America Great’ hat – OFFER EXPIRES SOON*** WATCH Wheeler get mobbed below: WATCH Wheeler getting tear gassed below: Fox News continues: Scenes devolved and Wheeler was later shuttled to a building by his security team, who had to scuffle with protesters who got in Wheeler’s face, yelled expletives and kicked at the door, which his security team could be seen on video struggling to close. “F— you. F—ing p—ies,” members of the crowd yelled, in video posted by Baker, after another member yelled, “See you tomorrow night, huh?” But Wheeler isn’t the only mayor to have faced a backlash from protesters, despite their sympathies toward them. Democrat leaders have proven that they have absolutely no control over their cities which is why President Trump is now taking action. During a press briefing on Wednesday, President Trump announced that he would be sending a “surge” of federal law enforcement agents to Chicago and other major cities after local leadership has failed to stop the massive surge of crime and murder in the city. “No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city,” President Trump said during the press briefing. ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship.

The Prime Minister highlighted that it would be difficult for police officers to do so after being verbally and physically attacked by Black Lives Matter protesters. Mr Johnson suggested he wouldn't take the knee out of fear it would make another person's life difficult. Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't believe in gestures, I believe in substance. I believe in doing things. ""If you look at what this Government has done over the last few years, when I was running this city, I massively increased black and minority representation in the Metropolitan Police. ""I want to see that happen across the country. ""What we've seen in the last 10 years is young black kids doing the toughest subjects in school, we've seen more young black kids going to the best universities in this country and that's what I want to see.""

He added: ""I don't want people to be bullied into doing things that they don't necessarily want to do at any given moment. ""If you think what happened with those police officers standing at the Cenotaph, they were being insulted in quite aggressive terms by some members of the crowd and being told to take the knee. ""Some of them did and it was very difficult then for the others who didn't.  ""I think it's very important that you don't do things that make life difficult or embarrassing for others.""

It comes as the death in Minneapolis of a black man, George Floyd, after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes has sparked protests around the world, with many demonstrators kneeling in streets and squares to protest against racism. The position was first taken by National Football League player Colin Kaepernick during the playing of the US national anthem to call attention to racial injustice, and has been adopted by many sports players since.

Please read our Commenting Policy first. Anti-mask rallies at Calgary’s Olympic Plaza and outside the Alberta legislature in Edmonton drew crowds Sunday afternoon as the province continues to deal with the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. In Calgary, the rally was held in response to city council’s upcoming deliberations on mandatory mask usage. Read more: Could masks become mandatory in Calgary? Mayor isn’t ruling it out On Monday, city council is slated to begin discussions on whether masks should be mandatory on transit and some indoor areas where physical distancing measures can’t be followed. A rally against mandatory masks is underway at Olympic Plaza. Crowd chanting “no new normal.” Calgary city council is set to debate mandating masks at tomorrow’s meeting. #YYC #COVID19 @GlobalCalgary pic.twitter.com/kWvKf73pI8 — Adam MacVicar (@AdamMacVicar) July 19, 2020  However, some in the city don’t believe being forced to wear a mask is the answer to stopping the spread of the virus. “Having a choice in this instance is actually very important because there are a lot of categories in our society that are going to be negatively affected by this mask mandate,” Eskesen said. Mayor Naheed Nenshi, alongside health and government officials, has repeatedly stressed the importance of wearing a mask when in a crowded indoor space. However, as more businesses continue their operations, Nenshi noted the need is bigger now than ever to stop a resurgence of the virus so the city can continue to rebuild its economy. “It’s not mask-wearing or the economy. It’s wearing a mask to save the economy,” Nenshi said Thursday. A crowd also gathered in Edmonton, where protesters carried signs with slogans disparaging mask use. In a news conference Saturday, Premier Jason Kenney also addressed the anti-mask rallies. He noted that while some residents have their reservations about wearing masks, the alternative outcome of a second wave could have devastating effects on the province. “My pitch to those folks, if they’re upset about mask usage, is that that the alternative will inevitably be more widespread suspensions of economic activity if we get a second outbreak,” he said. “I think the responsible exercise of personal freedom through mask usage, where people cannot physically distance, is a lot better than suspending businesses or social activity.” A protest against making the use of face masks mandatory is underway at the #AbLeg. #YEG pic.twitter.com/8jcYAqL0qS — Chris Chacon (@ChrisAChacon) July 19, 2020  Kenney added that while his government doesn’t want to strong-arm the public into wearing face coverings, he hopes residents will take the threat of the virus seriously. “All it takes is the exponential growth of a highly-infectious virus of this nature for it to perspectively come back and overwhelm our health care system,” Kenney said. “I would much rather that we prevent that through the widespread use of masks rather than the government big-footing in and suspending the operation of all sorts of businesses that would have massive social and economic consequences.” But Eskesen is concern about other social consequences. “There are so many people out there that have issues with masks for different reasons, one being claustrophobia. People who are claustrophobic can get a lot of anxiety over wearing a mask, same with people with other anxiety issues, people on the spectrum,” he said. “People with spectrum disorders can have a lot of issues with masks, not just wearing them but interacting with people who have them on, it makes them uncomfortable a lot of the time.” Read more: Masks in the mountains: Banff considers mandatory face coverings during COVID-19 pandemic With Calgarians expressing their concerns for mandatory face mask policies at Sunday’s rally, Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, noted that many people’s reservations on the subject stem from “conspiracy theories” and inaccurate information. He added there’s substantial evidence that using face masks will help stop the spread of droplets in the air, and could help slow the spread of the virus. “The emerging evidence for face masks is that they are very effective at doing one thing — restraining your own droplets,” Furness said. Read more: Coronavirus: University of Alberta study finds growing public support for face masks Furness added that he believes a good start for Calgary would be for businesses to get on board with implementing their own mask protocols, instead of a city-wide policy. “I don’t think that imposing fines and really trying to beat people into submission is going to be effective,” he said. “What you need to do is establish a social norm where masks matter.”. – With files from Kirby Bourne, 630 CHED and Adam MacVicar, Global News Get a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday.

6180,https://cdllife.com/2020/rep-calls-for-withholding-of-transporting-funding-if-protests-on-highways-continue/,Rep calls for withholding of transporting funding if protests on highways continue,"A Minnesota Representative and trucking company owner is asking federal authorizes to withhold transportation funding if cities continue to allow protests to occur on highways. In a Facebook video, Minnesota Rep. Cal Bahr said that he sent letters to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Gov. Tim Walz, Minnesota Department of Transportation Commissioner Margaret Anderson Kelliher and Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington requesting they withhold funding transportation if cities continue to allow protests on highways. “Today I sent a letter to Attorney General Barr and Governor Walz urging them to put an end to allowing protesters to gather on our interstates. In the past few months, we have seen two of our primary interstates blocked by protesters, putting many lives in danger. The lack of penalties for these actions has encouraged others to protest in this same way,” the Facebook post states. “I encourage you, your office, along with other federal agencies, to use every tool at your disposal up to and including withholding federal funds if these actions are allowed to continue.” – Rep. Cal Bahr, the Facebook post states. In his letter, Bahr, a CDL holder and trucking company owner, referenced the May 31st incident that involved a tanker truck encountering protesters on the highway. “As someone who has a commercial driver’s license myself, I know firsthand how dangerous this situation is for all concerned. On May 31st, a fuel hauler named Bogdan Virechko was trapped on the I-35W Bridge, blocked by protesters, which MNDOT had failed to secure properly. MNDOT has cameras everywhere along that road, and knowing that they had been unable to restrict traffic in that area, they allowed protesters to block it anyway. “The situation could have resulted in many deaths but for the actions of Mr. Virechko, who was beaten by protesters and jailed for his trouble. I don’t need to tell you that allowing situations like this to develop in Minnesota and other states strike at the heart of our interstate commerce system and our rights as citizens to move freely about the country and engage in transactions of all kinds. We are just coming out of a significant supply chain disruption due to the Government’s response to COVID-19. The federal government was founded to protect us from these types of local disturbances, and I ask you to intervene to uphold the law to protect commerce at this most basic level,” the letter states.

6224,https://news.yahoo.com/little-evidence-protests-spread-coronavirus-151221209.html,Little evidence that protests spread coronavirus in US,"NEW YORK (AP) — There is little evidence that the protests that erupted after George Floyd’s death caused a significant increase in U.S. coronavirus infections, according to public health experts. If the protests had driven an explosion in cases, experts say, the jumps would have started to become apparent within two weeks — and perhaps as early as five days. But that didn’t happen in many cities with the largest protests, including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. In what’s considered the first systematic look at the question, a team of economists determined that only one of 13 cities involved in the earliest wave of protests after Memorial Day had an increase that would fit the pattern. It was Phoenix, where experts say cases and hospitalizations surged after a decision by Gov. Doug Ducey to end Arizona’s stay-at-home order on May 15 and eased restrictions on businesses. Arizona residents who were cooped up for six weeks flooded Phoenix-area bar districts, ignoring social distancing guidelines. In many cities, the protests actually seemed to lead to a net increase in social distancing, as more people who did not protest decided to stay off the streets, said that study’s lead author, Dhaval Dave of Bentley University. “The large-scale protests can impact both the behavior of the protesters and the behavior of the non-protesters,” said Dave. The paper was released last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, but has not been published by a peer-reviewed journal. Drawing from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, The Associated Press reviewed trends in daily reported cases in 22 U.S. cities with protests. It found post-protest increases in several cities — including Houston and Madison, Wisconsin — where experts say other factors were more likely the main drivers. Health officials are still investigating case surges in different states, and more data may come in. But experts believe that if the protests did have a big impact on cases, stronger signs would be apparent now. Floyd was killed on May 25 by a Minneapolis police officer who used his knee to pin Floyd’s neck to the ground. The killing of a Black man at the hands of a white officer touched off protests around the United States. Coincidentally, some states had begun to lift social distancing restrictions in late May. Dave and his colleagues counted protests over three weeks in 281 cities with populations of at least 100,000. Most had protests lasting more than three days, and many had protests that had at least 1,000 participants. It's not clear how many protesters participated, let alone how many of them wore masks or got tested after. That may have varied from place to place. Houston is among a number of Texas cities that have recently seen steep increases in cases and hospitalizations. Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the county health department, believes it was likely some cases could be traced to the protests. ""We just don't know how much,” he said. But it's hard to measure the protests' precise impact for a number of reasons, Shah and others said. Earlier business reopenings and more willingness to shrug off social distancing guidelines started the trend in the Houston area, Shah said. Another factor: Many people don't get tested unless they feel symptoms. Many protesters were young adults, who generally are less likely to get severe illness, and therefore may not have gotten tested, experts said. And some who do get tested may still not answer all the questions they are asked by outbreak investigators. “I know of three people who told us ‘Yes, I was at a protest.’ That doesn't mean there was not another 25 or more who did attend a protest and just did not share that with us,"" said Dr. Mysheika Roberts, the public health commissioner for the city of Columbus, Ohio. That city has seen increased cases in the last month, but health officials say they can't attribute it to any particular reason other than people socializing and returning to normal activities without wearing masks or taking other precautions. So far, protests don't seem to be a real factor. “Most of the protests, at least in my jurisdiction, were outside,” and the virus does not spread as well outside, Roberts said. ""And I would say 50% of those at the protests were wearing a face mask."" ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

IF YOU CAN PROTEST IN PERSON, YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2020  Trump’s tweet came as protests continue in several major cities following the death of George Floyd May 25 while in the custody of Minneapolis police. While many state governors have enacted stay-at-home regulations for residents, they allow for protesters to gather in large groups, with or without masks. The president said Monday that if universal mail-in voting is allowed, the U.S. is “never going to have a fair” presidential election. In a wide-ranging phone interview with the hosts of “Fox & Friends,” the president said that mail-in voting can allow fraud. “I have to tell you that if you go with this universal mail-in … tens of millions of ballots being sent to everybody and their dogs, dogs are getting them, okay? People that have been dead for 25 years are getting them, you have to see what’s happening. Then you’re never going to have a fair election,” Trump said. Related: The Hidden Difference Between Absentee And Universal Mail-In Voting While fewer than 10 states currently have universal mail-in voting, where ballots are mailed to every registered voter, Democrats are pushing for wider use of the practice, which has prompted the current battle over the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called lawmakers back into session to hold hearings on the USPS. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced on Tuesday that he will suspend several cost-cutting initiatives in an effort “to avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail.” Trump said he’s currently taking steps to fix what he called a long-term “disaster” in the USPS’s finances. “This isn’t a Trump thing. This has been one of the disasters of the world, the way it’s been run,” Trump said. “What am I supposed to do, let it continue to be run badly?” And Trump called Pelosi’s move a “con game,” saying there is already ample money available to the USPS. “The Post Office, there’s $25 billion sitting there, but they really want $1 trillion to bail out their badly run states,” Trump said of Democratic lawmakers. Trump also said he would support extending voting to include the weekend before Election Day and adding additional voting booths to ease crowding. “I would support all of that. That’s what you want to do,” Trump said. “I would be for opening more voting booths.” And the president said he’s OK with absentee voting. “I totally support [that],” Trump responded. “That’s a great thing.” Meanwhile, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Tuesday sued New Jersey over Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters, saying Murphy’s move is illegal and will create a “recipe for disaster” for voter fraud. “In a direct usurpation of the legislature’s authority, Gov. Murphy issued Executive Order 177 … purporting to rewrite the election code for the November 2020 election. This brazen power grab was not authorized by state law and violates both the Elections Clause and Electors Clause of the U.S. Constitution and federal law,” the lawsuit alleges.

6369,https://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/08/frankie-banali-death/,Frankie Banali Dead: Quiet Riot Drummer Dies at 68,"Getty Franki Banali, the drummer for the band Quiet Riot, died on August 20, 2020 at age 68. Frankie Banali, the drummer for the heavy metal band Quiet Riot and W.A.S.P, died on August 20, 2020, as reported by his wife, Regina Banali. He was 68. On April 17, 2019, Banali was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer and was given six months to live. “He put up an inspiringly brave and courage 16-month battle to the end,” his wife wrote in a statement. In November 2019, Banali opened up about his diagnosis. He said his decision to keep performing live stemmed from the fact that he had “everything to win and everything to lose in this situation. I intend to treat it the way I treat everything, which is to put everything into it and fight it all of the way to the end.” Regina shared some of Banali’s biggest career moments as a musician in her statement. She wrote that Banali was “most known for his lengthy career as the drummer for that multi-platinum heavy metal band Quiet Riot whose ‘Mental Health’ was the first heavy metal album to reach number one on the Billboard chars and ushered in the 80s metal band era. He is the only member to play on every album Quiet Riot released.” “His signature tone, deep pocket, and iconic drum intros are immortalized on many hits including Quiet Riot’s ‘Cum on Feel the Noize,’ ‘Mental Health (Bang Your Head), Billy Idol’s ‘Mony, Mony,’ and ‘L.A. Woman.’ and albums such as Hughes/Thrall and W.A.S.P.’s ‘Headless Children and Crimson Idol,’ as well as over 100 other recordings as a session player in every drama.” Born on November 14, 1951 in Queens, New York, Banali relocated to Los Angeles in the mid-70s. He spent about a year in New Steppenwolf, which was an offshoot of the hard-rock legends led by their former bassist Nick St. Nicholas. In 1979, Banali left to begin working with singer Kevin DuBrow, whose band, Quiet Riot, had broken up after guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Rudy Sarzo left to play with Ozzy Osbourne, according to ultimateclassicrock.com. The prolific drummer is survived by his daughter, Ashley, whose mother was Banali’s first wife Karen, who died in 2009. Banali is also survived by his second wife, Regina, who directed him in the 2015 documentary Quiet Riot: Well Now You’re Here, There’s No Way Back. Regina said that the end of Banali’s life came after “standard chemotherapy stopped working and a series of stroked make the continuation on a clinical trial impossible. He ultimately lost the fight at 7:18 p.m. on August 20.”  FacebookFrankie Banali and his first wife Karen Banali on their wedding day. Ashley and her dad remained incredibly close. In March, she shared a moving prayer of hope for him on her Facebook page. She wrote, “My gratitude is through the roof for every single prayer that has been sent for my father. He is nothing short of hero in my eyes and many others. I love this man with all of my heart. To The strongest person I know. Keep fighting as you are doing so well. You are so inspiring. I love you to moon and back and then some.” In June, while speaking on Sirius XM’s Trunk Nation with Eddie Trunk, Banali discussed how he was still in treatment and undergoing chemotherapy. He said, “I knew that when we were switching from the first chemo formula that we were doing for almost a year to the new chemo formula, I knew in advance that the different formula was really gonna wipe out the hair.” “Right now you probably wouldn’t recognize me,” Banali said. “Not only did it take all the hair on the top of my head, but it took my beard, my eyebrows, my eyelashes. Let me put it to you this way: I have just really improved my Olympic swimming chances with the loss of body hair.”  Getty(L-R) Musicians Tony Franklin, Frankie Banali, Phil Soussan and Vinny Appice pose at the Rock ‘N’ Roll Fantasy Camp at AMP Rehearsal Studios on November 6, 2015.

Beckett wrote,” [Banali] has undergone 17 rounds of chemo so far, and several palliative procedures to ease symptoms and has been able to make it past the one-year point and even continue playing with the band. It has been a very difficult, painful, and agonizing journey that is not nearly over. He has been getting second opinions, out of network follow up biopsies, infusions, and treatments of alternative therapies that have kept his body strong enough to withstand the chemo. “This endeavor has accumulated a mountain of medical expenses and now with the pandemic canceling or postponing the entire spring touring season he now being hit financially from the other side as well,” Beckett added, noting that she was aware it’s been a “rough time for everyone,” amid coronavirus. But “if you can contribute anything, it would be greatly appreciated.” It’s w/great sadness that I announce the passing of @FrankieBanali @QUIETRIOT .As many know Frankie had been battling cancer & passed away last night.

The Kentucky Football team is joining the movement against racial injustice. Sources tell KSR that the team has collectively decided to walk out of today’s practice in support of the ongoing protests in sports following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Yesterday, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted Game 5 of their series vs. the Orlando Magic, prompting the postponement of all NBA Playoff games through today. The WNBA and several MLB teams did the same, and many NFL teams have canceled practice today in solidarity. Yesterday, UK associate head coach Vince Marrow weighed in on the matter on Twitter, commending head coach Mark Stoops on his handling of social issues.

Before the march began, Stoops addressed his players, urging them to seize the moment and stand up for justice. “We’re here to fight racism, to bring awareness, and to do our part,” Stoops said. “I think most of you know me, I keep things pretty tight to the vest with the media, but there’s no more of that on this issue. Everybody needs to get off the bench and make a difference, stand for something. We’re not going to tolerate any more racism and social problems. We want to make a difference and be a part of the solution. That’s why we’re here.” Mark Stoops speaks to the media in front of the court house pic.twitter.com/7Bc6xoA24p — Zack Geoghegan (@ZGeogheganKSR) June 5, 2020  UK senior offensive tackle Landon Young also addressed the group and led protestors in prayer. “This is a group, this is a bunch of ethnicities, a bunch of colors, all coming together as one,” Young said. “I don’t care who you are, what your skin color is, no matter what, we will stand up against this injustice. It was wrong, and now, we have to move forward. The road is long, the road will have obstacles, but we have a bunch of leaders that are here to make a stance. Hear their voice and make a difference. I want to thank Coach Stoops, thank all the coaches who helped put this together.” UPDATE (4:39 PM): A Kentucky spokesman confirmed that the team decided not to practice and is currently meeting to discuss ways to promote their influence and be a part of effective change. Josh Paschal, Luke Fortner, and members of the team’s unity council will talk to reporters on Zoom this evening to discuss the conversation. Nick Roush will have a full report on the site shortly after. No, I will not make you a sandwich, but you can follow me on Twitter @MrsTylerKSR or email me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the Bucks announced that they were boycotting the game because they were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Sunday, the NBA announced it was postponing all games scheduled for that night: “The NBA and the NBPA today announced that in light of the Milwaukee Bucks’ decision to not take the floor today for Game 5 against the Orlando Magic, today’s three games – MIL-ORL, HOU-OKC and LAL-POR have been postponed. Game 5 of each series will be rescheduled.” In response, Obama tweeted that he commends the Bucks for their actions – and said “It’s going to take all our institutions” to take action: “I commend the players on the @Bucks for standing up for what they believe in, coaches like @DocRivers, and the @NBA and @WNBA for setting an example. It’s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values.” I commend the players on the @Bucks for standing up for what they believe in, coaches like @DocRivers, and the @NBA and @WNBA for setting an example.

Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back by Kenosha Police Department officers in front of his children on August 23 following a domestic violence call. Kenosha police officers were responding to a domestic incident near 28th Avenue and 40th Street around 5:11 p.m, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Attorney General. Jacob was trying to break up a fight between two women when he was tased and then shot by police, The Kenosha News reported. In a graphic video posted on social media, two officers are seen following Jacob to a gray van with their weapons drawn. As Jacob enters the vehicle, one of the officers is seen grabbing and pulling on Jacob’s shirt and shoots multiple shots into his back. A woman in the video is seen frantically screaming and jumping up and down following the shooting. The 29-year-old was sent to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition, according to The Kenosha News. NBA Agent and Jacob’s childhood friend, Daniel Poneman, wrote on Twitter that Jacob was out of surgery and currently in the ICU fighting for his life. “He is out of surgery and in the ICU. He can make it through this. He is fighting for his life. Please please please pray for Jacob Blake,” Poneman wrote. https://twitter.com/DanielPoneman/status/1297750493498941441 The attorney general stated that the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ), Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI), is investigating the shooting and the officers involved were placed on administrative leave as of August 24. Following the shooting, demonstrators gathered outside the scene of the shooting to protest, WDJT-TV reported. The city of Kenosha issued a city-wide curfew until 7 a.m. on August 24 because of the protests. ""It goes back to the Emmett Tills. We're tired of it. Rodney King. We're tired of it. And right now, this is the wrong generation that this is happening to. The frustration is boiling to the top and we're sick and tired,"" said Clyde McLemore, founder of Black Lives Matter of Lake County, Illinois, told the news station. The shooting comes just days after the fatal police shooting of Trayford Pellerin in Louisiana and anti-racism protests following multiple police-involved deaths. Who is Jacob? Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Jacob and his family, posted on Twitter that he is a father whose three sons witnessed the shooting while sitting in the backseat of the vehicle Jacob was trying to enter. “Jacob Blake’s 3 SONS were IN THE CAR he was getting into when @KenoshaPolice shot him tonight. They saw a cop shoot their father. They will be traumatized forever. We cannot let officers violate their duty to PROTECT us. Our kids deserve better!!” Crump wrote. https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1297741652568805377?s=20 Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said in a statement that he is calling for some empathy from elected officials “in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.” “We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country—lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites,” the statement read. Jeffery Robinson, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) Trone Center for Justice and Equality, called the shooting “another vicious act of police violence caught on camera.” “Unfortunately, disgusting acts of police brutality like this will be commonplace so long as police continue to act as an occupying force in Black communities,” Robinson said in a statement to The North Star. “It should now be clear to elected officials across the country that the only way to end the scourge of police violence is to immediately divest from a policing institution that, from its inception, has been used to oppress Black people, and reinvest into the same communities that those horrific acts of violence are regularly perpetrated against. Policing is a crisis in and of itself, and we can no longer throw money and resources at an institution as hopelessly broken and expect to get different results.” For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.

Text to Speech CNN -- the network where Brian Stelter preaches that the Republicans and Fox News are guilty of ""asymmetric lying"" -- was dramatically bending reality in the 5 am hour on Tuesday. On Early Start, they went live to correspondent Omar Jimenez, who described the images of buildings ablaze as being in “stark contrast” to the events going on in the daylight, “which were largely peaceful demonstrations.” The chyron was unbelievable: ""FIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOOTING"". Before turning to Jimenez, co-host Laura ""daughter of Valerie"" Jarrett explained ""There were protests in several other cities yesterday as well, most of them peaceful, although an officer was attacked with a cane in San Diego."" OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Laura, what you're seeing is one of multiple locations that have been burning in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the course of the night, a second night since Jacob Blake was seen shot in the back seven times by a police officer. And what you are seeing now, these images came in stark contrast to what we saw over the course of the daytime hours in Kenosha and into the early evening, which were largely peaceful demonstrations in the face of law enforcement. It wasn't until night fall that things begun to get a little bit more contentious. Things were thrown back and forth. Police started using some of those crowd dispersal tactics like tear gas, even playing really loud sounds to push them. And then what you're seeing, a common theme that ties all of this together is an expression of anger and frustration over what people feel really like has become an all too familiar story playing out in places from across the country not just here in Kenosha, Wisconsin -- Christine, Laura. Jimenez is the 26-year-old CNN reporter who was wrongly arrested by police in Minneapolis during the George Floyd-spurred rioting. CNN then turned that mistake into an ad about their own heroic riot coverage. As Tristan Justice at The Federalist noted, Jimenez was also the reporter on scene on Monday's Situation Room where the CNN chyron was briefly accurate -- “8PM Curfew Ordered After Violent Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In Wisconsin” -- until they nixed the V-word after a few seconds. This early-morning Jimenez segment immediately caused most conservatives to recall a similar mind-bending incident by MSNBC's Ali Velshi in Minneapolis on the Lyin' Brian Williams show in May, saying “this is… mostly a protest...It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”  The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where truth and liberty flourish.

Around 100 people showed up for the Erase Child Trafficking event “to show our solidarity with others across the country and raise awareness to the fastest growing industry in the world- Child trafficking,” its Facebook page read. The page continued: The media is deafeningly silent on this issue plaguing the United States, which is THE destination country based on supply and demand. Texas has the second largest number of child traffickers and victims, following Washington D.C. Let’s unite and spread awareness to this horrifying problem since the media has failed to do so. “Please come together for this #SaveTheChildren movement so that we can raise our voices for the voiceless! We will not let child sex trafficking be swept under the rug any longer!” it concluded. Kendra James Erase Human Trafficking Protest Amy Furr/Breitbart News Activist Kendra James said she believed the Internet played a huge role in shedding light on the issue. “But the fact that everybody on the social media groups are censoring it makes it an even bigger deal while promoting pedophiles and saying pedophilia is a sexual orientation and not a disease,” James told Breitbart News. Where Are All the Children Sign. Amy Furr/Breitbart News Human trafficking is a supply and demand business, according to Unbound Fort Worth, a local organization dedicated to helping survivors and resourcing the community to fight the problem. “Supporting the commercial sex industry, whether by viewing pornography or purchasing sex, creates profit for traffickers. End the demand, and we end trafficking,” the site read. Event organizer Lathina Finder echoed James’ statement and said, because the issue was out in the open, “It’s up to us to stop it.” “Because obviously our legislatures and our Congress and all them are not going to. With media, they’re not gonna do this issue. So, we’re doing it,” she explained. Why Is the Media Silent Sign. Amy Furr/Breitbart News Finder also urged citizens to join the movement. “Get involved. Get out of your house. Stop acting like someone else is going to take care of this,” she said, adding, “It’s up to us, it’s up to Americans, right now.” “If you love your country and you love your kids, it’s up to you to get out of the house and get on the street or be part of an organization.

The police chief didn’t want these ‘peaceful protesters’ in her yard, so she wrote a letter to the City Council instructing them to “forcefully call for the end of these tactics.” Advertisement - story continues below It’s all fun and games to the radical left-wing officials until the militants show up to their home. Via the Seattle Times: TRENDING: LIVE STREAM VIDEO: Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium August 10-12 -- Live At Frank Speech -- Starting at 9 AM Central from Sioux Falls, South Dakota Best wrote a letter to the council Sunday after protesters showed up outside her Snohomish County home Saturday night, the latest in a series of visits the demonstrations have paid to those who hold public power in Seattle, including City Council members and Mayor Jenny Durkan. Residents blocked a road into Best’s neighborhood, according to the letter and posts on social media from that evening. Multiple posts that appeared to come from Best’s neighbors referred to protesters as “terrorists,” and at least one included a photo of a gun. Advertisement - story continues below Best’s letter said her neighbors “were concerned by such a large group” and didn’t allow protesters to “trespass or engage in other illegal behavior in the area, despite repeated attempts to do so.” She didn’t elaborate on the behavior in question but wrote that the Snohomish County sheriff was “monitoring the situation.” Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney said most of the protesters were dispersing or had already left when deputies arrived. He said he spoke with Best, who was not at home at the time, on the phone and “assured her that the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office would deploy whatever resources were necessary to protect her, her family and her property.” Best’s neighbors weren’t in the mood to host malcontents protesting in their neighborhood. Armed residents confronted the protesters and the exchange further confirmed why the 2nd Amendment is essential for our protection and to ensure our freedoms. “We are peaceful! You pointed a gun at my face!” the protester yelled to the armed residents. Advertisement - story continues below Resident: “That’s why you are peaceful.” Mic drop.

KENOSHA, Wis. - Three vehicles, a black school bus, bread truck and tan minivan were stopped by Kenosha police Wednesday evening, Aug. 26 after police said officers suspected the occupants ""were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest."" This, on the fourth night of protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, and a night after two people were fatally shot during demonstrations. Police said this began with a citizen tip that the vehicles planned to meet in a remote lot near State Highway 50 and Green Bay Road. Officers began surveilling the vehicles after locating them, assisted by U.S. Marshals -- and confirmed the out-of-state plates. Police said officers followed them to a gas station near Washington Road and 30th Avenue, where officers observed the occupants of the bus and bread truck exit and attempt to fill multiple fuel cans. Credit: Jenna Sykora At this point, ""suspecting that the occupants of these vehicles were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest,"" officers attempted to make contact and investigate. Police noted, ""the officers exited their vehicles, identified themselves, were wearing appropriate identification and then detained the occupants of the bus and bread truck."" The driver of the minivan tried to pull away, but the vehicle was stopped and police forced entry -- arresting the occupants. According to police, the vehicles contained various items that included helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks and suspected controlled substances. The nine individuals were arrested for disorderly conduct and are pending charging decisions by the Kenosha County district attorney. “Jacob did nothing to provoke police. He was a great father and was only intending to get his children out of a volatile situation. Witnesses confirm that he was not in possession of a knife and didn’t threaten officers in any way,"" Benjamin Crump said in a statement Thursday on the shooting of Jacob Blake by Kenosha police. Investigators haven’t explained why police drew guns on Blake and why the officer opened fire. They say a knife was found in the SUV, but they have said nothing about what role it may have played.

People who purportedly identified themselves as “PRESS” on their clothing during the ongoing protests in Portland were seen throwing objects at law enforcement officers during demonstrations-turned-riots overnight, according to a reporter on the ground. Andy Ngo, editor-at-large of The Post Millennial, tweeted late Wednesday local time that protesters from the crowd of demonstrators “throwing projectiles at officers” included people who had marked themselves as “PRESS.” The person who captured the video that Ngo shared, who identified themselves as part of a “press collective in PDX,” did not include any information on their own Twitter page about ""press"" allegedly throwing the items. The video also shows someone pointing a large green laser at the officers. A mattress lit on fire during riots in Portland. PORTLAND POLICE DECLARE RIOT AT ICE BUILDING Portland has endured more than 80 nights of increasingly violent and destructive demonstrations that have at times devolved into riots. It’s also not the first time people who had identified themselves as being members of the press have allegedly acted out. Late Saturday into Sunday morning, police said people who identified themselves as “press” threw objects at police. Two officers went to the hospital after being injured by flying objects, which included a 9.5-pound rock, police said. FIRE SET INSIDE PORTLAND'S MULTNOMAH BUILDING DURING UNREST, RIOT DECLARED A day before, police said “several people with ‘press’ affixed to them shined flashlights in officers eyes.” At the beginning of the month, people with “press” markings repeatedly threw objects at police, the Portland Police Bureau reported. On Wednesday night, authorities declared a riot at a Portland protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. People spray painted windows on the building, used traffic cones to block security cameras, and tried to break windows, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported. PORTLAND ATTACK VICTIM SAYS HE TRIED TO STOP ROBBERY: 'THEY WOULDN'T LET ME GET UP' Demonstrations in which fires have been set, objects have been thrown and police have fired “crowd control munitions” have gripped Oregon’s biggest city for more than two months following the police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Whitney Reddick, who teaches special education in Jacksonville, Florida, posted the mock death notice to Facebook Aug. 4. In it, she proclaims that she died “while alone in isolation and on a ventilator at a Duval county hospital” last week at age 33. “Even though she shouted from the rooftops, attempted to be unemotional, and educated herself in facts and science, she succumbed to the ignorance of those in power,” the obituary reads. “She returned to work, did her best to handle all the roles placed on her shoulders; educator, COVID-security guard, human shield, firefighter, social worker, nurse, and caregiver but the workload weakened her, and the virus took hold.” “Whitney was taken from us,” it continues. “Yes, of course too soon, but we are the ones left with holes in our hearts, missing how big hers was.” Mourners are then encouraged to send “condolences” to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) and the Duval County school board and superintendent. According to its website, Duval County public schools are slated to reopen next Thursday with both in-person and remote learning options for students. Though Reddick said in an interview she’ll return to her classroom as scheduled, she added that she’d prefer her district keep classes for all students remote, given that coronavirus cases in Florida continue to surge. “I felt the gravity of the situation and the obit took that on,” she told “The Today Show” last week. She said that in the debate over reopening schools, educators “no longer became people who had families and loved ones, we became a tool in restarting an economy. I wanted it to hit home that teachers are people and have families and loved ones.” And Reddick, the mother of a 1-year-old boy, said she’s mostly concerned about what would happen to her family if she were to contract COVID-19. “I love my job so much,” she told CBS Jacksonville. “What if I go on a ventilator? What if my husband gets sick? ... Who takes care of our son? What if I pass away? What if he passes away?” In an email, Duval County Superintendent Diana Greene told HuffPost she and her staff planned to “rise to the challenge” of teaching amid the pandemic. “Teaching is a public service, but it is unlikely any of us thought about a long-term global pandemic when we chose this path to serve children,” she said. “I empathize with the fears some teachers have expressed, and I also empathize with the needs of 130,000 children and their families.” “With the resources and guidance available to us, we must move forward with every feasible precaution to support our employees and to serve those students who need us in classrooms,” she added. As of Thursday, more than 550,901 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Florida. The state had a testing positivity rate of 13.45%, according to Johns Hopkins University. The university’s statistics on Thursday showed almost 9,000 deaths in Florida attributed to the coronavirus, fifth-most in the U.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum. He then walks past Rosenbaum without incident. Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, has been charged with fatally shooting Rosenbaum and 26-year-old Anthony Huber and wounding a third - Gaige Grosskreutz, 26. Rittenhouse shot one of his victims five times including in the head, the criminal complaint reveals - but his attorney has claimed it was he who was 'attacked' and insisted he was acting in self-defense. Rittenhouse's attorney Lin Wood said the 17-year-old vigilante was 'attacked' with 'lethal force' and 'had the right to defend himself' when he shot dead the two Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man, Grosskreutz. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, one of two people killed during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night, was filmed shortly before his death taunting a group of armed individuals. Rosenbaum is seen on the right in the reddish-brown t-shirt ‘Shoot me, n*****,’ the 36-year-old Rosenbaum is heard saying in the video in which he is seen confronting several armed men One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap (left) and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum Attorneys representing Rittenhouse have said he acted to defend himself. Kenosha County prosecutors said in court records this week that Rosenbaum was the first person Rittenhouse shot at around 11:45pm on Tuesday. Prosecutors said Rosenbaum followed Rittenhouse into a used car lot, where he threw a plastic bag at the gunman and attempted to take the weapon from him. The medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin, back and left hand. The wounds fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead. The two men who were killed were Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, (left) and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, (right) about 15 miles west of the city. Huber's devastated girlfriend broke her silence over his 'murder' Friday, saying her 'heroic' boyfriend died trying to save the lives of her and other protesters Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, pictured with his fiancée and a young daughter, died Tuesday evening Gaige Grosskreutz (left) - the suspected killer's third and only surviving victim is pictured in hospital recovering after the shooting. On right is his left arm where he was shot Grosskreutz pictured clutching his bloodied arm after Rittenhouse shot him at close range Tuesday night Grosskreutz getting medical attention after the shooting. Grosskreutz, aged 26, was legally permitted to be carrying his handgun. Rittenhouse meanwhile is 17 and so was illegally carrying the AR-15 rifle he used to shoot Grosskreutz and the two other victims Friends have told local media that Rosenbaum was originally from Texas and previously lived in Arizona before moving to Wisconsin this year, where his young daughter lives. According to his Facebook page, he worked at a Wendy's restaurant in Kenosha. Rosenbaum is survived by a fiancee and a young daughter. ‘May you forever be with the angels and rest easy bro. I love you!’ his sister wrote on Facebook. After shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone, before he tripped and fell, according to the complaint and video footage. Huber, of Silver Lake, Wisconsin, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrestle the gun away from Rittenhouse, the complaint said. Hannah Gittings, Huber's girlfriend, told WBBM-TV that he pushed her out of the way before chasing after the man others on the street had identified as the shooter. Huber’s friends gathered at a Kenosha skate park this week to remember him and his passion for skateboarding. According to court records, Huber had a skateboard in his right hand and used it to ‘make contact’ with Rittenhouse’s left shoulder as they struggled for control of the gun. Other protesters remembered Huber on Wednesday night near the spot where he was shot, and Gittings told the group that he was an amazing person. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, has been charged with first degree intentional homicide following the shooting death of two protesters in Kenosha on Tuesday. Social media photos show the teen had a strong admiration for law enforcement and guns Much of Rittenhouse's Facebook is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter - the movement that supports police. He also previously participated in a youth public safety cadet program (pictured), according to social media ‘He took down an armed gunman with nothing but his (profanity) skateboard,’ Gittings said, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Kenosha News reported that local protest organizers said both Rosenbaum and Huber had participated in demonstrations this spring and summer, beginning with the May death of George Floyd after a Minnesota police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed man's neck. ‘They came out here every time with us,’ said Porche Bennett, a Kenosha resident who has organized protests. ‘Sweet. Loving. They were the sweetest hearts, souls. I called Anthony my hippie guy. They were sweet guys.’ Bennett said she was particularly grateful to Huber, who stood in front of her when authorities used tear gas during protests outside the Kenosha County Courthouse this week. According to court records, Huber has a criminal record that includes several arrests for battery, drugs and other charges. At the time of his death, Rosenbaum had an open criminal case on battery, disorderly conduct and domestic abuse charges. The third man to be shot was wounded in the left arm. Court records said Grosskreutz appeared to be holding a gun when he approached Rittenhouse after he shot at Huber. Grosskreutz is an activist who volunteered as a medic during the Kenosha demonstrations, according to Milwaukee activist Bethany Crevensten. Jacob Blake (pictured) was shot seven times in the back by a cop in front of his three young children Sunday. Outrage is building over the cops' response to white teen Rittenhouse compared to black man Blake The image above shows the moment a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer fired at least seven shots into the back of Jacob Blake as he was getting into an SUV in a residential neighborhood The images above show the moments leading up to the shooting. Blake (seen in the white shirt) walks away from a police officer who has his gun drawn She said Grosskreutz was part of a group of roughly two dozen activists who have demonstrated around Milwaukee in the wake of Floyd’s death and went to Kenosha to protest. Grosskreutz, who was wearing a backpack and cap labeled ‘paramedic,’ was shot in the arm, Crevensten said. ‘He was a hero and he is a hero,’ she said. Grosskreutz, of West Allis, was recovering after surgery and was not yet giving interviews, Crevensten said this week. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Grosskreutz is a senior at Northland College in Ashland and the college registrar's office said he is set to graduate in December. Kyle Rittenhouse's (pictured Tuesday night) attorney has claimed he was 'attacked' and was acting in self-defense when he shot dead two unarmed Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man in the streets of Kenosha Tuesday night, as new video reveals a different angle to one of the attacks The video shows the vigilante shooting his third and only surviving victim Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm as the 26-year-old was carrying a handgun. This came moments after Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, and called a friend to say 'I've killed someone' Grosskreutz is armed with a handgun in his right hand and appears to come towards Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse opens fire at Grosskreutz at close range shooting him in the left arm. Wisconsin is an open carry state, meaning people aged 18 and over are legally allowed to carry a gun. Grosskreutz is over 18, Rittenhouse is not A grab of Rittenhouse's extradition hearing on Friday morning. He did not show his face The paper also reported that he previously worked as a special events coordinator, wilderness medical instructor and sea kayak guide at Lost Creek Adventures in Cornucopia, according to an online LinkedIn profile. The company offers kayak tours, rentals and programs on wilderness skills within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Rittenhouse, a police-obsessed Donald Trump supporter, appeared before a judge briefly on a Zoom call on Friday. His extradition hearing has been pushed back another month. He will return to court on September 25. The teen is faced with murder charges while outrage builds nationwide over the different treatment by cops of the white armed teen compared to their treatment of Blake. Rittenhouse faces five felony charges that include first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide, and a misdemeanor charge for possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor.

Share This Story Amnesty International is urging law enforcement to reform its policing policies, after identifying 125 human rights violations during the Black Lives Matter protests. On Tuesday, the organization released a report in which it documented alleged abuses committed by federal, state, and local police officers between May 26 and June 5 across 40 states. After analyzing police responses to the demonstrations sparked by George Floyd's death, Amnesty concluded that law enforcement had violated people's rights to peaceful assembly through the use of intimidation and violence. The organization specifically noted the use of tear gas, smoke, and percussion grenades, which were not only used against protestors, but also bystanders and journalists. Per the report: Using heavy-duty riot gear and military-grade weapons and equipment to police largely peaceful demonstrations intimidates protesters exercising their right to peaceful assembly. Equipping officers in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable rather than possible and may escalate tensions between protesters and police ... As seen in many countries, inappropriate or excessive police interventions can actually lead to violence and disorder rather than reducing tensions. Indeed, police will have a propensity to use the weaponry they are deployed with and so should not be deployed with weapons that are inherently inappropriate for the operation they are conducting. Amnesty also launched an interactive map that marked instances of police violence during the demonstrations. The map was a result of an extensive investigation that included the analysis of 500 videos and photos posted on social media as well as consultation with weapons and law enforcement experts. In some of these cases, Amnesty was able to interview the victims and confirm police conduct with local authorities. Related Stories STORY CONTINUES BELOW ""The analysis is clear: When activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets in cities and towns across the USA to peacefully demand an end to systemic racism and police violence, they were overwhelmingly met with a militarized response and more police violence,"" said Brian Castner, senior crisis advisor on Arms and Military Operations at Amnesty International. ""The time for applying band-aids and making excuses for a few ‘bad apples’ has passed."" Amnesty is calling on federal, state, and local officials to make sweeping changes to the way law enforcement responds to protests. The organization has urged lawmakers to limit the use of lethal force and ""ensure that everyone under their jurisdiction can enjoy their human rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression."" Amnesty has also demanded each law enforcement agency to revise the policing policies in accordance with international human rights standards, including those laid out in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials. ""What’s needed now is systemic, root-and-branch reform of US policing that brings an end to the scourge of police use of excessive force and extrajudicial executions of Black people,"" Castner said. ""Communities should not live in fear of being harmed by the very officers that have sworn an oath to protect them. Officers responsible for excessive force and unlawful killings must always be held accountable."" Join the conversation on Complex today! Share This Story",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Vanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman, the president is angry that he can't hold any of his trademark campaign rallies in Florida amid its weeks-long surge in COVID-19 cases. What's more, Sherman's sources say Trump is putting the blame for this predicament at the feet of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been eager to follow the president's commands to reopen state economies even as the country records more than 50,000 infections and 1,000 new deaths from the novel coronavirus every day. ""He thinks Ron has made it a lot worse,"" one Republican who spoke with Trump said. Trump was forced to cancel his planned RNC acceptance speech in Jacksonville after public health officials told him there was no way to safely hold a mass gathering in the city without risking mass COVID-19 infection. Nonetheless, one aide tells Sherman that ""rallies are his jam"" and that ""Trump won’t be happy until he is doing multiple rallies a day."" The novel coronavirus crisis in Florida continues to grow more and more dire. As flagged by Bloomberg News' Steven Dennis, Florida has once again smashed its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations and now has 15,169 residents hospitalized with the disease. Even more alarming is the fact that nearly 47 percent of all intensive care unit beds in the state are being taken up by COVID-19 patients, which Dennis says is the highest percentage in the nation right now. The latest numbers mark a major jump from just two days ago, when Florida reported having 13,793 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has so far completely refused to enact any measures that could possibly slow down the spread of the disease and has even threatened to withhold pay from school administrators who want to implement mask mandates for students and faculty. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has similarly banned school districts from enforcing mask or vaccination requirements, is now asking hospitals to postpone all elective surgeries while he looks for out-of-state health workers who can help his state cope with the deadly pandemic. Earth has warmed 1.09℃ since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report also found escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth, and every facet of the weather. The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November. The IPCC is the peak climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. It is the global authority on the state of Earth's climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment. Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today. But there is still time to avert the worst damage, if humanity chooses to.  For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally — leaving absolutely no room for doubt – humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans. The IPCC finds Earth's global surface temperature warmed 1.09℃ between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29℃ warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1℃ of the increase is due to data improvements.) Read more: Monday's IPCC report is a really big deal for climate change. So what is it? And why should we trust it? Trump-loving podcaster and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on Tuesday said that America's founders would have launched a military strike against ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" events if such things existed in the late 18th century. In his podcast, Kirk sought to dispel what he called ""lies"" about America's founders and their tolerance for what Kirk considers to be sexual deviancy. ""One of the lies about the founding fathers is that they were strictly small-l libertarians,"" he said. ""And that's just not true... For example, let me just tell you this: If Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, or John Adams saw drag queen story hour, they would mobilize the Minutemen."" It is unclear what about transgender people reading stories to children would require a military response, but Kirk insisted that such an attack would have been within the framers' conception of human liberty.

6924,https://ijr.com/portland-police-precinct-set-fire-riots-intensify/,Portland Police Precinct Set On Fire As Protests and Riots Intensify,"Demonstrators set a Portland, Oregon, police precinct on fire Sunday evening as the event was declared a riot by the law enforcement agency. On Monday morning, the Portland Police Department released a statement along with footage of the unrest that erupted several hours prior. According to the police department’s statement, a crowd of approximately 200 protesters gathered in the streets of Portland late Sunday evening at around 9:41 p.m. Shortly after the gathering began, it intensified to protests, and “someone lit a canopy against the building on fire.” The law enforcement agency detailed how the fire erupted. “The fire began to burn to the siding of the building, so officers on the roof got a fire extinguisher to try and put it out. As they were putting out the fire, multiple people pelted the officers with rocks,” the statement read. “A lieutenant was struck with a chunk of ceramic, causing a cut to his hand. A second awning was also lit on fire close to a tree. That caused damage before it was extinguished.”  Amid the precinct fire, the police department detailed a number of other incidents that occurred on Sunday evening. According to the department, the majority of participants wore “armor, helmets, gas masks, all-black clothing, and carried shields.” The statement also indicated that the riot began when a dumpster was set on fire and pushed into an intersection. Law enforcement officials also claim the burning dumpster was used to shield to protect rioters as they hurled multiple objects at officers including: “Almost immediately, from behind the shields and elsewhere, individuals began throwing chunks of ceramic, rocks, and glass bottles in the direction of the officers. Green lasers, which are capable of causing permanent eye damage, were shined at officers. At least one balloon filled with feces was thrown at officers on the roof of the building.” At one point, a commercial-grade firework, paint bombs, rocks and even “marbles were launched by at least one wrist rocket style slingshot,” according to the police department. As a result of the fire, “Two North Precinct awnings were lit on fire, and officers were targeted by protesters with sharp chunks of ceramic, rocks, mortars, and powerful lasers during a riot Sunday evening into Monday morning.” We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism. Read our editorial standards. “It is like nails on a chalkboard.” “I know a number of have asked whether the president talked to [Cuomo] since this report came out, the answer is no.” “The best way I can help now is to step aside and let government get back to governing.” Nineteen Republicans voted for it. “We are in a critical situation now.” “The hypocrisy of the left knows no bounds.” “That means no mask mandates, regardless of your vaccination status.” “The account will be in read-only mode for a week due to repeated violations of the Twitter Rules.” “Cuomo, who is ensconced in the governor’s mansion in Albany and has not been coming to the office, is left with few advisers.” “I didn’t think that I was just going to be killed.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6961,https://news.sky.com/story/thousands-of-people-protest-after-lukashenko-landslide-in-belarus-12046214,Thousands of people protest after Lukashenko landslide win in Belarus election,"Authoritarian Alexander Lukashenko has won another term - but there are concerns that the election was not run fairly. Monday 10 August 2020 10:24, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Police and protesters have clashed in the capital of Belarus and other cities after a contested presidential election which saw the country's long-time leader secure a landslide victory. Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, won the election with 80% of the vote, the election commission said - according to preliminary results. However, there is widespread suspicion that the election was not fair, with two opposition candidates denied places on the ballot before one of them was jailed and the other fled to Russia.  On Monday morning Reuters reported that at least one person was killed and 120 protesters had been detained, citing the Viasna human rights group. Many were injured in clashes with riot police who were deployed on the streets to disperse protesters. ""It was a peaceful protest, we weren't using force,"" said 23-year-old protester Pavel Konoplyanik, helping a friend to hospital who had a plastic grenade fragment stuck in his neck. ""No one will believe in the official results of the vote, they have stolen our victory."" The main opposition candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, was targeted during the weekend: eight members of her staff were arrested and one of her aides fled the country. Ms Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher and wife of a jailed opposition blogger, had received large displays of support leading up to the election - unusual in a country where dissent is rarely tolerated. But opposition supporters said they expected election officials would manipulate the election results in favour of Mr Lukashenko. After the vote on Sunday, thousands of protesters gathered in Minsk where police used truncheons to beat them and flash-bang grenades in an effort to get them to leave. Protesters tried to build barricades with rubbish bins. There were also demonstrations in the cities of Brest, Gomel, Grodno and Vitebsk and police fired tear gas at people in Brest, according to news reports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is unclear how many people were injured or arrested but the Association Press quoted Ales Bilyatsky of Viasna as saying there had been several hundred arrests. Among them were three journalists from an independent Russian TV station and an AP journalist was beaten by police and taken to hospital. But for some voters, Lukashenko's long, hard-line rule was a plus. ""He is an experienced politician, not a housewife who appeared out of nowhere and muddied the waters,"" said retiree Igor Rozhov. ""We need a strong hand that will not allow riots."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, Ms Tsikhanouskaya said she did not believe the polls, saying: ""I will believe with my own eyes. The majority was for us."" After voting earlier in the day, she had said: ""I hope that everything will be peaceful and that the police will not use force."" As he voted, Mr Lukashenko had said: ""Do you want to try to overthrow the government, break something, wound, offend, and expect me or someone to kneel in front of you and kiss them and the sand onto which you wandered? This will not happen."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mr Lukashenko has been in power since July 1994 but many have become frustrated with his authoritarian rule, the struggling economy and his failure to recognise the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. He has dismissed the illness as ""psychosis"" and advised people to ""drink vodka"" and ""go to saunas"" to ward off the virus. Two weeks ago, the 65-year-old said he had caught COVID-19 and recovered ""on his feet"" without showing any symptoms.  He has not brought in any restrictions to limit the spread of the virus, despite more than 68,500 confirmed cases and 580 deaths - numbers that critics say are manipulated. Ms Tsikhanouskaya tapped into this frustration as she campaigned across the former Soviet country of 9.5 million people. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe was not invited to send observers to the election. © 2021 Sky UK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6972,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-berlin-protest/,Thousands protest against coronavirus measures in Berlin,"In-depth reporting, data and actionable intelligence for policy professionals – all in one place.      Demonstrators ignore hygiene rules to rally in German capital. Thousands of people, packed close together and not wearing face masks, protested in Berlin on Saturday against official measures intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Police said they would file charges against the organizer of the gathering as demonstrators had not followed hygiene rules such as maintaining social distancing or wearing a mask covering nose and mouth. Some 17,000 people took part in the demonstration at its peak, according to police. The gathering was organized with the title ""The end of the pandemic — day of freedom."" Some demonstrators chanted ""the biggest conspiracy theory is the pandemic,"" according to German media reports. A Stuttgart-based organization called Querdenken 711 — which roughly translates as ""thinking outside the box 711"" — organized the rally. The interior minister for the city of Berlin, Andreas Geisel, said on Friday that neo-Nazi organizations had also called for people to participate in the march. German media outlets noted that ""Day of Freedom"" was also the name of a Nazi propaganda film documenting the party's 1935 party congress in Nuremberg. One banner at the march called for politicians such as German Health Minister Jens Spahn, Bavaria's state premier Markus Söder, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leading virologist Christian Drosten to be ""locked away."" Protesters also ""aggressively asked"" journalists to remove their masks by protestors, newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported. A video by Querdenken 711 before the march said the group was peaceful and called on attendees to be polite to journalists. Sawsan Chebli, a senior official in the Berlin city government, called the protest ""a disaster."" ""I just came from abroad and see these pictures. Many look to Germany, and admire us for how we have dealt with corona. Such pictures are a disaster. They destroy everything. They endanger human lives and destroy livelihoods. They scare me,"" she tweeted. ‘I don’t want to do without it,’ the German ex-chancellor said about the popular sausage dish. With infection numbers on the rise, Berlin braces for the fall. Head of Oxford Vaccine Group says vaccination won’t stop spread altogether. Spokesperson maintains there was ‘no wrongdoing’ on behalf of the former British PM.

7033,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mauritius-environment-protests-idUSKBN25P0G8,"Thousands protest in Mauritius over dead dolphins, demand resignations","Discover Thomson Reuters By Giulia Paravicini 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters demonstrated in the Mauritius capital Port Louis on Saturday to demand an investigation into an oil spill from a Japanese ship and the mysterious death of at least 40 dolphins that have been found near the site of the spill. Environmentalists have called for an investigation into whether the dolphins died as a result of the spill caused when the bulk carrier, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month. One protestor held a banner with a dolphin covered in oil reading “our lives matter” and another held one calling for the government to resign. Mauritian flags were waved across the packed square of St Louis Cathedral. “We do not trust the government and the diluted information they’ve been feeding us regarding the management and responses to the oil spill,” Fabiola Monty, 33 a Mauritian environmental scientist, told Reuters from the square. The government has said it will carry out autopsies on all the dead dolphins and has set up a commission to look into the oil spill. Two investigations are being carried out: one by the police on the crew’s responsibilities and one by a senior Shipping Ministry official on what happened to the ship. So far veterinarians have examined only two of the mammals’ carcasses, which bore signs of injury but no trace of oil in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, according to Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Fisheries Ministry. Local environmental group Eco-Sud, which took part in Saturday’s protest, said in a statement on Friday that representatives from civil society should be present during the autopsies and called for a second opinion from independent specialists.

Nearly 50 demonstrators lay scattered 6 feet apart wearing face coverings on the lawn outside the school administration's building, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Some protesters held signs resembling tombstones with phrases like ""R.I.P. campus safety,"" or ""In loving memory.""  HAPPENING NOW: @universityofga students and staff hold unique “die-in” in protest of school’s planned fall reopening. #UGA pic.twitter.com/t5fjWhZiBb  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in roughly 160,000 deaths in the U.S. since the start of the outbreak in January. Older adults are typically more prone to severe coronavirus infections, although individuals with weakened immune systems are also at high risk. The demonstrators have a list of demands corresponding to the protest, including petitions for more COVID-19 testing and offering faculty members the liberty to teach remotely. Currently, faculty must seek permission from the school to teach remote online courses. The group submitted a petition with 1,002 signatures along with the list of demands to an employee in the administration building. Graduate student Bryant Barnes said the school's current testing plans would not be enough to accommodate consistently testing all students and employees. Sujata Iyengar, a professor at the school since 1998 who joined protesters, said she thinks university officials ""have not thought this through,"" adding that more classes should be held outside rather than indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. ""We have affirmatively addressed the core of these concerns through our comprehensive planning over the summer,"" the school said in the statement, adding that the university has committed $250,000 for emergency funds to aid students who have critical and sudden financial emergencies.

7097,https://www.thestevesanchezshow.com/protests-not-allowed-on-mayors-street/,Protests Not Allowed On Mayor's Street (Yet City Can Suffer),"PROTESTS NOT ALLOWED: The Chicago Police Department has banned protests near Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s home. REASON: In July protesters rallied near the Mayor’s residence and due to threats she reportedly receives daily, heightened security was put in place. WHY IT’S HYPOCRITICAL: Protests have been allowed to dominate business and residential areas since May. Vandalism of property, arson, blockades, looting, violence, and organized acts of terrorism have all been watched by certain Democrat officials. Often supported without condemnation. Now that the wildfires of anarchy are seemingly uncontrollable, officials that could have and should have stopped it earlier are protected. Yet businesses, properties, and people’s daily lives continue to suffer. BANNED: What’s most hypocritical is that according to a report, not even peaceful protests are allowed near the Mayor’s home. CHECK OUT: Watch the Portland Mayor protected by private security after the anarchists he stood with surge and get aggressive. Back in July, a report surfaced saying that the police had banned protests from the Logan Square neighborhood, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot lives. It referred to a directive from Melvin Roman, the Shakespeare District Commander, written to officers under his command. It stated that once the order to move was given by police officers, any protesters who remained should be arrested. The directive did not differentiate between peaceful or violent protests. The Mayor should just put signs up saying “Protests Not Allowed.” CHECK OUT: Mayor on the hunt for criminal mastermind who wrote hate speech on a road sign. The sign read “All Lives Matter.” Both the Mayor and Police Chief apologized for the act. Some might say that this move by the Mayor and Chicago Police Department is against the First Amendment, it isn’t. It only seems that way because of the chaos, violence, and ignorance shown by some elected officials. By law, officials can define times and places protests take place. If done so neutrally and reasonably. However, the keyword is peaceful. A violent protest is not legal. CHECK OUT: Child shot by anarchists, at an anarchist barrier that a Mayor was negotiating over.

She continued: “I’m not going to make any excuses for the fact that, given the threats I have personally received, given the threats to my home and my family, I’m going to do everything I can to make sure they’re protected.

7144,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/aug/27/ted-wheeler-portland-mayor-gets-fed-up-with-violen/,"Ted Wheeler, Portland mayor, gets fed up with violent protests: 'Enough is enough'","Sign In Manage Newsletters The fall of sexual predator Andrew Cuomo Anti-gun lobbyist David Chipman unsuited to run the ATF Where are the illegal immigrants going? Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler took aim Wednesday at what he called “a few dozen individuals engaged in violence” who he said have allowed the Oregon city to be wrongly portrayed as a “dark dystopia” by President Trump and others. Mr. Wheeler took some of the blame himself, saying he and other leaders have allowed the city’s reputation for protest to be hijacked by rioters bent on violence, swamping what should have been a thoughtful conversation on racial justice and policing. “They’re intent on creating mayhem and attacking and harming people, not just property,” the mayor said in an online press conference Wednesday night. “That’s a line that we can’t allow our community to cross. Not anymore. Enough is enough.” TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestreamNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill The mayor is the latest figure on the left to condemn rioting that has started to dominate the racial justice conversation sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The final straw appears to have been when rioters brought their violence to his doorstep. After weeks of smashing windows and lighting small fires at police buildings, the federal courthouse and other public offices, protesters marched on Portland’s city hall Tuesday night, breaking in and scrawling graffiti. Hours later, Mr. Wheeler said it was time to put an end to that side of things. “Pulling people from their vehicles and beating them in the streets is a horrific, violent crime,” he said, describing an assault caught on video from earlier this month, for which a protester has been arrested. Mr. Wheeler, who also serves as police commissioner, rejected demands for a $50 million cut to the police budget as a first step to assuage protesters. He said his goal is to rethink policing and to have the broadest conversation possible. He said he’s been trying to get a sense for the myriad sets of demands from those who are protesting — most of whom are peacefully marching, but several hundred of whom nightly pick targets for mayhem. “I had a meeting last week where a group of people frankly just shouted expletives at me. That was how they wanted to use their time. I had to end it a little early because my daughter was in the room,” Mr. Wheeler said. Mr. Trump this week renewed his call for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown to request him to deploy the National Guard. Ms. Brown, on Twitter, said the state’s National Guard is fighting forest fires and said Mr. Trump could better use his time trying to assist the state in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. “Oregon isn’t interested in a role in your political theater,” she told the president. But Ms. Brown, a Democrat, also signaled that she, too, is worried that the protests are beginning to stain Portland and the racial justice debate. “Let me be clear: It’s time for the violence and vandalism to end so Portland can focus on the important work to be done to achieve real change for racial justice. Those who have committed acts of violence will be held accountable,” she said. Wednesday night, after Mr. Wheeler held his press conference, was the first night this week that police did not declare a riot. That doesn’t mean things were calm. Demonstrators marched on the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, disabling security cameras, vandalizing the building and pelting federal police with bottles and fist-sized rocks. Demonstrators also tried to blind the officers with lasers. About 200 people were involved, the Portland Police Bureau said. Seeing the violence, the local officers moved in, declaring the gathering an unlawful assembly — a level below a riot — and pushing the crowd away. The Portland officers said they, too, were pelted with rocks. After they’d pushed the crowd away from the ICE building, they disengaged, and the protesters started back toward ICE. Portland police say they moved in to make targeted arrests. One protester used pepper spray on police, and a fire was ignited, police said. Local police made 11 arrests, including charging one 26-year-old with unlawful use of pepper spray.  Copyright © 2021 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

It's not a complicated thing."" Hall of Fame NFL coach Mike Ditka tripled down on his stance against protests during the National Anthem, once again telling players to “go to another country” if don’t like the United States. Speaking with Newsmax TV on Monday, the former Chicago Bears coach said that playing professional football is an incredible “privilege” that few enjoy. “Football’s football. It’s not a complicated thing. You’re playing the game, you’re enjoying the game. You don’t like the game, get out of it,” Ditka said. “It’s not for protesting one way or the other. What color you are, what you think, this or that. You play football. That’s it. You’re privileged. You got a gift from God that you can play the game because you got a body you can do it with. I don’t really understand what you’re protesting. I played the game. I coached the game for a long time. It makes no sense to me.” Ditka then advised those players protesting to leave the country if they do not like it here. “I would tell those players go to another country and play football there,” he said. “You don’t have to come out. You don’t have to come out if you go to another country. You can’t! Because the game’s only played in this country. And if you can’t respect this country, get the hell out of it.” NFL 🏈: Hall-of-Fame coach Mike Ditka tells protesting players that if 'they can't respect this country, get the hell out of it.' [with Newsmax TV's @ShaunKraisman https://t.co/VlT7z8drtO] pic.twitter.com/E3jPCBrMdt — Newsmax (@newsmax) September 14, 2020  Mike Ditka has been an outspoken opponent of the National Anthem protests going all the way back to 2016 when he said that former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick should “get the hell out” of the United States if he wants to disrespect the country. Over the summer, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, Ditka repeated this sentiment. “If you can’t respect our national anthem, get the hell out of the country. That’s the way I feel. Of course, I’m old fashioned, so I’m only going to say what I feel,” said Ditka. “I think there’s a way you protest and a way you don’t protest. You don’t protest against the flag and you don’t protest against this country who’s given you the opportunity to make a living playing a sport that you never thought would happen. So, I don’t want to hear all the crap. You wanna try it, try it. You don’t, it’s okay.” As The Daily Wire reported last week, ratings for the NFL season opener for Thursday Night Football were markedly lower than those of the previous year, though it’s not clear if anti-racism and anti-police brutality protests played into the decline in viewership. “The Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs’ 34-20 victory over the Houston Texans averaged about 19.3 million viewers on NBC, according to preliminary ratings,” reported The Hollywood Reporter. “That’s down about 13 percent from the 22.12 million who watched last year’s kickoff, but ahead of the 19 million who tuned in for the 2018 kickoff.” RELATED: WATCH: Mike Ditka On Kneeling During Anthem: ‘If You Can’t Respect Our National Anthem, Get The Hell Out Of The Country’ The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

7272,https://www.dailywire.com/news/report-kenosha-city-owned-property-sustained-2m-in-damages-mayor-asks-for-30m-riot-relief,"REPORT: Kenosha City-Owned Property Sustained $2M In Damages, Mayor Asks For $30M Riot Relief","Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, cost the city an estimated $2 million to city property alone, according to one city official who believes, by the end of an ongoing assessment, the cost will be much higher. “The city’s public works director, Shelly Billingsley, provided the estimate to local leaders Monday night on what it would cost to replace garbage trucks, street lights, and traffic signals, among other things that were destroyed or damaged in the unrest over the last week,” ABC News reported Tuesday. The city is insured, but as Minneapolis, Minnesota, residents are now finding out, insurance coverage for riot damage is limited, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, where “dozens” of business owners are now finding out that demolition costs, particularly, won’t be reimbursed in full. The damage to city services may also hinder Kenosha’s public works department in the long term. According to Billingsley, the garbage and utility trucks that were destroyed or damaged in the riots that followed an officer-involved shooting that left 29-year-old Jacob Blake in critical condition, function as snowplows in the winter, and the city may not be able to replace them before the first snowfall which, in Wisconsin, could come as early as October. Those trucks “were parked downtown to provide security and limit movement by protesters, were set on fire during the demonstrations.” Kenosha’s mayor said Monday that he plans on asking the state and federal governments for assistance, and his initial request is $30 million, with the understanding that that number could climb significantly. Individual businesses, now picking up the pieces following three nights of nearly unrestricted rioting, looting, and arson, are also finding that the cost to rebuild may be more than anticipated. According to Fox Business, the used car dealership that rioters burned during the first night of unrest, sustained $1.5 million in damages by itself. “The owners of Car Source in Kenosha told local affiliate FOX 6 Milwaukee the business suffered $500,000 in property damage plus between $900,000 and $1 million in inventory damage during the first night of civil unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man,” the outlet reported. “More than 50 cars were reported to have been damaged in the early Monday morning blaze.” “Another local business, Dale’s Jewelry, lost $200,000 worth of jewelry and incurred another $200,000 in property damage,” Fox 6 Milwaukee added. That’s just the beginning. Local media reports include information about dozens of businesses affected by the unrest, and more than a dozen internet fundraisers, designed to help family-owned businesses recover and eventually rebuild, are now active. President Donald Trump, defying requests by the Wisconsin governor and other Democratic officials to stay away from the riot-torn area, will tour Kenosha on Tuesday and survey the extensive damage left from last week’s unrest. His opponent, Democratic 2020 presidential nominee, Joe Biden, addressed the riots in a speech on Monday but neglected to condemn the violence specifically, instead opting to blame Trump’s rhetoric for ongoing, national demonstrations and subsequent damage.

Organizers planned the worship service at Gas Works Park on Labor Day, but the city said it would shut the service down ""due to anticipated crowding that could impact the public health of residents,"" over the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Seattle Parks and Recreation does not allow unpermitted public events to take place in Seattle parks and asks the public continue to adhere to current public health guidelines so that we can keep our parks open,"" the city added. Sean Feucht Ministries condemned the decision and called out the city's hypocrisy on political rallies. ""This is the height of hypocrisy for the City of Seattle to turn a blind eye to riots, looting, and AntiFa, while refusing to let Christians gather in a public park to sing and worship,"" said Feucht in a statement on Facebook. ""First the government shuts down churches. Now it's shutting down parks to stop us from worshipping. Time to stand up church!"" he added. Hundreds of his supporters heeded the call and showed up on Monday to the ""protest worship"" service. Feucht, a missionary and musician, led the event, and later posted a statement to his social media account. ""America was founded on the freedom to worship. Politicians can write press releases. They can make up threats. They can shut down parks. They can put up fences,"" he wrote.

Tensions boil over during protests on both coasts The 100th consecutive night of protests in Portland quickly escalated into a riot Saturday as people hurled ""multiple fire bombs, mortars, rocks and other items"" at officers, police said. One of the homemade bombs caught a community member on fire. Medics offered treatment at the scene, and the injured individual was later taken to a hospital by a private vehicle, according to a press release from the Portland Police Bureau. ""This criminal activity presented an extreme danger to life safety for all community members, and prompted a declaration of a riot,"" the law enforcement agency said in a statement early Sunday. More than 50 people were arrested overnight, including at least two who were clad in body armor. One individual was armed with a dagger while another had a knife, police said. The names of those arrested and their charges were not immediately released. Video posted on social media shows what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being thrown into the middle of crowd and exploding into flames on a residential street. One person's legs appears to catch fire as they run away. The video shows police in riot gear using flash-bang grenades while making loudspeaker announcements, ordering people to disperse the area. Some demonstrators are seen setting off fireworks in the street as police advance. A sergeant was struck by a commercial-grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Several other law enforcement officers were hit by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders and feet, with only their protective gear preventing serious injury, police said. Meanwhile, an Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents. The Portland Police Bureau said ""it was clear that the intent of the crowd was not peaceful protest,"" as many people were carrying large shields and were dressed in protective gear, including helmets, gas masks and body armor. The unrest in Oregon's largest city erupted following the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck as three other officers watched. Protests in cities across the United States and around the world are calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice. Many of the recent demonstrations in Portland have ended in arson, vandalism and violence. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested by authorities there since late May, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-seven people were arrested following a march Friday night, according to police, who accused protesters of throwing rocks at officers and chanting ""burn it down"" outside the offices of the Portland Police Association.

Kamala Harris (CA) seemingly encouraged the activists to continue their demonstrations. The protests broke out Wednesday evening in Louisville and later other cities across the nation after a Kentucky grand jury did not bring murder charges against the officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor. “Tonight, I’m thinking of Breonna Taylor’s family who is still grieving the loss of a daughter and sister,” Harris wrote.

In the wake of her tragic death, we mourn with her mother, family, and community and ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America.” In his statement, Biden called for no violence and suggested Americans start “addressing the use of excessive force, banning chokeholds, and overhauling no-knock warrants.” Biden added: A federal investigation remains ongoing, but we do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna. We know what is necessary. We need to start by addressing the use of excessive force, banning chokeholds, and overhauling no-knock warrants. I know people are frustrated and they have a right to peacefully protest, but violence is never acceptable. And we can express pain, grief, anger, and disappointment at the way things are, but remain focused on rebuilding trust in our communities and delivering change that can be. Two Louisville Metro Police Department Officers were also shot early in the evening of the protests on Wednesday. According to a press briefing from authorities after the shooting, one officer is recovering and the other officer is undergoing surgery. Several other protesters in Louisville attempted to set fire to the Hall of Justice and other areas of Louisville. Both Biden and Harris later released statements on the two officers who were shot in Louisville. “.@JoeBiden and I are keeping the police officers who were shot in Louisville in our hearts, wishing them a swift and speedy recovery,” Harris wrote. “Violence is not the answer and we must find a way to express our grief, anger, and demands in ways that reflect the world we wish to see.” .@JoeBiden and I are keeping the police officers who were shot in Louisville in our hearts, wishing them a swift and speedy recovery.

By Nellie Bowles PORTLAND, Ore. — Terrance Moses was watching protesters against police brutality march down his quiet residential street one recent evening when some in the group of a few hundred suddenly stopped and started yelling. Mr. Moses was initially not sure what the protesters were upset about, but as he got closer, he saw it: His neighbors had an American flag on display. “It went from a peaceful march, calling out the names, to all of a sudden, bang, ‘How dare you fly the American flag?’” said Mr. Moses, who is Black and runs a nonprofit group in the Portland, Ore., area. “They said take it down. They wouldn’t leave. They said they’re going to come back and burn the house down.” Mr. Moses and others blocked the demonstrators and told them to leave. “We don’t go around terrorizing folks to try and force them to do something they don’t want to do,” said Mr. Moses, whose nonprofit group provides support for local homeless people. “I’m a veteran. I’m for these liberties.” Nearly four months after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, some protesters against police brutality are taking a more confrontational — and personal — approach. The marches in Portland are increasingly moving to residential and largely white neighborhoods, where demonstrators with bullhorns shout for people to come “out of your house and into the street” and demonstrate their support. These more aggressive protests target ordinary people going about their lives, especially those who decline to demonstrate allegiance to the cause. That includes a diner in Washington who refused to raise her fist to show support for Black Lives Matter, or, in several cities, confused drivers who happened upon the protests. But the tactics are dividing supporters of Black Lives Matter, with some worried that the confrontational approach will antagonize people who would be otherwise be receptive to the message, or play into conservatives’ critique of the protests, which have been largely nonviolent nationally. Others, frustrated that little has changed since Mr. Floyd was killed, say that sitting idly and watching a protest without participating nowadays is to show tacit support for racism. “We don’t need allies anymore,” said Stephen Green, an investor and entrepreneur in Portland who is Black. “We need accomplices.” In Rochester, N.Y., protesters have confronted people at outdoor restaurants, shaking dinner tables. Marchers in Washington also accosted people eating outside, urging everyone to raise their fists to show their allegiance to the movement. The more personal tactics echo those being used against elected officials, with activists showing up not only outside mayor’s offices but their homes as well. The apartment building where the mayor of Portland lives has been vandalized. Protesters lit fires outside, ignited fireworks and broke into one of the businesses in the building on his birthday. In San Jose, Calif., demonstrators graffitied and egged the mayor’s house and lit an American flag in front of it, according to the police. In Rochester, people have recently posted police officers’ home addresses and information about their families, according to a police spokeswoman. In Portland, Jessie Burke, a local business owner who has Chinese ancestry and identifies as biracial, said the message of the movement was getting lost as the protests escalate and target ordinary residents in their homes. “Everyone was looking for solutions at first, but now it’s just a nightly fight that has gotten progressively more violent — and every neighborhood worries that the fight will come to their neighborhood,” Ms. Burke said. “It’s: ‘Wake up, wake up, you need to be in the street protesting if you stand for this.’” Still, Mr. Green argued that the tactics were working, even as they inconvenienced him and his family. He described the smell of tear gas and wail of sirens as the marches came to his neighborhood, which he said kept his 7-year-old daughter awake. “It’s one thing if you can see something on TV, but if you can hear it and you can smell it in your house, that brings it home,” said Mr. Green, who grew up in Portland. “We need people willing to say, ‘I’m down to lose this friend because stuff needs to change. I’m down to make my neighbor uncomfortable.’ Being nice wasn’t changing anything.” Lindsey E. Murphy agreed. She marched with the protesters through one of Portland’s wealthiest neighborhoods on a recent night and found it deeply moving. She watched white demonstrators shouting at white residents that Black lives matter — and the residents joining in with the chant. “The crowd was — I won’t even say mostly white — I’ll say it was an almost exclusively white crowd marching through the whitest neighborhood in Portland shouting ‘Black lives matter’ and ‘Black lives are magic,’” said Ms. Murphy, who is Black and hosts an educational children’s YouTube series. “What I was witnessing was a lamenting prayer, a cry of remorse and shame among the white people. That’s what I saw. It was healing.” The American flag that generated controversy is displayed in Kenton, a neighborhood of Portland with small bungalows, lush front gardens and ripe fruit trees. Weeks after the confrontation, the husband and wife who fly the flag said they were fearful of retaliation from the roving protesters, who had found their phone number. But they say they will not be intimidated into removing the flag. “I will not take my flag down,” said the husband, who declined to provide his name in a brief interview. The same night the protesters came to the couple’s door last month, they marched into Kenton’s commercial district and used restaurant picnic tables as fuel for fires. They collected the colorful wooden dividers the neighbors had recently built for outdoor dining and set those ablaze as well. Mr. Moses and others in the community ran into the protests with fire extinguishers. Protesters that night broke into the Portland Police Association building and set it on fire. A man was later seen scrubbing the sidewalk graffiti — a popular message was “PPB = KKK,” meaning that the Portland Police Bureau is the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Green said that he opposed the destruction of property, but that he also understood it. And he believes, generally, that the more direct protest tactics in residential areas are working because they make the movement more personal, and reveal who truly supports change. If someone is against the movement, they keep their lights off or refuse to raise their fist, he said, adding that taking the debate into homes and to families is essential. Some residents in Portland say the tactics are escalating as the protests become increasingly dominated by white people, including anarchists and supporters of antifa, the diffuse collection of militant left-wing activists that has a strong presence in the region. The movement is splintered in Portland between more mainstream Black Lives Matter marches and the more aggressive, sometimes chaotic antifa or black bloc protests, where demonstrators dress in black and wear motorcycle helmets or ski masks to make it difficult to identify — or later prosecute — them. One night this month, there were two protests promoted on the Black Lives Matter Portland Events page: a “nonviolent protest” in the city center and “an autonomously organized direct action march.” No one appeared to be at the city center protest. But around 200 people were at the other event. They gathered in an unlit park in a residential neighborhood around 8 p.m. Everyone wore black, including some protesters who had on body armor and motorcycle helmets. They hastily set up picnic tables and supply booths in the dark, using cellphones for light to showcase their goods. There was a food table overflowing with protein bars and Monster energy drinks. A small free literature selection was set up on the grass and overseen by three people in ski masks. It was a popular offering, and people crowded around, craning to see the pamphlets. Titles included “Why Break Windows”; “I Want To Kill Cops Until I’m Dead”; “Piece Now, Peace Later: An Anarchist Introduction to Firearms”; “In Defense of Smashing Cameras”; and “Three-Way Fight: Revolutionary Anti-Fascism and Armed Self Defense.” The energy was something like a carnival in the dark. “Paint balloons, get your paint balloons,” someone barked. But around 9:30, the group was in some organizational chaos. They had decided that the neighborhood close by was too racially diverse for them to protest in. They needed to go somewhere whiter. So the protesters caravaned 20 minutes away to Alberta, a more affluent neighborhood that began being gentrified in the 1990s. They reassembled and marched through the streets. Neighbors in impressive Craftsman-style homes pulled down their shades and turned off their lights, though many could be seen peering out of dark windows. One woman stepped out of an expansive home looking angry; upon seeing the crowd, she quickly retreated indoors. A few young couples stood in their doorways. A Black woman driving past honked and cheered. One white man stepped onto his patio clapping and hollering in support of the passing march. The group called for him to join. He smiled and waved them on, still clapping. They began to chant that he was spineless. He looked worried. But the march moved along, and he went back into his house. “You’ll never sleep tight, we do this every night,” the protesters chanted. Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Says '99.9% of People Could be Doing It Right' in Louisville Protests,"Discussing Wednesday’s violent protests in Louisville, Democrat Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said Thursday that “99.99% of people could be doing it right” – then turned his comments to the threat of “white supremacy groups or militias also marching into town.” On Wednesday, two police officers were shot and a total of 143 people were arrested as mobs took to the streets to protest a grand jury’s decision in the case of the police-related shooting death of Breonna Taylor, Kentucky’s Courier-Journal reports: Louisville police arrested 127 people during Wednesday protests following the announcement that just one of three Louisville Metro Police officers who fired shots in Breonna Taylor's apartment will be criminally charged, and one suspect was arrested after LMPD officials said two officers were shot that night. … An additional 16 arrests were made downtown during the day, as department spokesman Lamont Washington said protesters moved a barricade at Sixth and Market streets to allow vehicles on to a closed downtown road before damaging multiple city vehicles. But, in an interview Thursday with The Courier-Journal, Kentucky Gov. Beshear not only suggested the protesters were 99% peaceful, he also warned of the threat of white supremacist groups and militias “marching into town” during the protests: ""What we saw last night is that 99.99% of people could be doing it right, but one person who wants to do the wrong thing can mar what is otherwise a nonviolent night where people are expressing how they feel,"" Beshear said of the protests in Louisville Wednesday. ""When we see white supremacy groups or militias also marching into town, it just shows that we need to make sure that we have the appropriate levels of peace officers in place to ensure that we can protect everyone and ensure that people are able to express themselves while being able to do it in a safe way,"" he continued.

7631,https://gizmodo.com/woman-arrested-for-facebook-post-promoting-anti-lockdow-1844926107,Woman Arrested For Facebook Post Promoting Anti-Lockdown Protest in Australia,"Police in Australia arrested a 28-year-old woman on Wednesday for publishing a Facebook post that promotes an anti-lockdown protest in the country’s state of Victoria. Footage of the arrest was captured by her partner and shows police officers handcuffing the woman and saying that she’s being charged with “incitement.” The woman’s phone and computers were also seized. The video, which was livestreamed on Facebook, has gone viral and shows the police eventually taking possession of the phone that was broadcasting the encounter. Over two million people have watched the video so far. “It’s in relation to a Facebook post, in relation to a lockdown protest you put on just that day,” detective Adrian Smith with the Victorian Police told the woman as she was handcuffed in her home. “I wasn’t breaking any laws by doing that,” the woman said, explaining that she had an ultrasound scheduled in an hour because she’s pregnant. “You are actually. You are breaking the law,” Smith responded. “That’s why I’m arresting you.” The woman and her partner, who reportedly live in the city of Ballarat, according to Australia’s ABC News, can be heard on the video offering to take the Facebook post down. But the detective insists that she needs to be arrested because she “already committed the offense.” The arrest appears to have involved at least four officers. “I’m happy to delete the post, this is ridiculous,” the woman said, pleading with the cops and noting that her two children are watching her get arrested. Victoria, which includes the city of Melbourne, has been under strict lockdown measures for the past month after a covid-19 outbreak caused an alarming spike in deaths. Police in Australia have arrested numerous people who’ve tried to stage protests against the lockdown, but this is the first known instance of someone in Australia being arrested for merely posting about a protest on Facebook. “The search warrant entitles us—and we’re required to—seize any computers, any mobile devices you have,” Detective Smith says. “I didn’t realize I was doing anything wrong. This is ridiculous,” the woman says. The woman can be seen getting very distressed as it becomes clear that she’s really being taken into custody and the detective barks “let me finish,” as he explains what the arrest warrant allows him to take. “Any mobile telephone you’ve got, okay?” Smith says, before the police turn their attention to the phone that’s broadcasting on Facebook. The Victoria Police Department issued a statement to Australia’s ABC News, saying that “Any gathering of this nature is in blatant breach of the Chief Health Officer’s directions and puts Victorian lives at risk.” “Those still thinking of attending the protest […] can expect a swift and firm response from police,” the statement continues. “We will have no hesitation in issuing $1,652 fines to anyone who is breaching the restrictions on the day, or making arrests if necessary.” The detective in the video, identified as Adrian Smith by the badge around his neck, appears to have been with Victorian Police since 2001, according to a profile on LinkedIn. Australia remains the only wealthy democracy in the world that doesn’t have anything equivalent to America’s First Amendment protections for free speech. And even though it’s clear lockdowns are sometimes necessary to defeat this global pandemic, it’s hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook. This will likely only inspire covid-deniers to become more ridiculous and radicalized than they already are. Far-right goons on Rupert Murdoch’s TV station Sky News Australia have been complaining for months that many actions to fight the covid-19 pandemic have been too extreme. And in this case, they might finally be right. “...it’s hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook.” Maybe not so hard - it’s an incitement to behavior that is counter to the health of the population during a pandemic. Victoria has been under strict lockdown for a month and she is advocating breaking the rules (or laws in this case). fb has a broader reach, so 2 million views occurred instead of a few at some illegal protest gathering. “Oh. I didn’t know!”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7673,https://www.dailywire.com/news/portland-police-change-tactics-crowd-control-ahead-of-protests-increased-arrests,"Portland Police Change Tactics: Crowd Control Ahead Of ‘Protests,’ Increased Arrests","Portland, Oregon, police offices debuted a new set of tactics Monday night, controlling protests before they turned violent and arresting suspected “anti-fascist” operatives when the smaller march threatened destruction. The techniques took Portland’s protest movement by surprise, Oregon Lives reports, and left some demonstrators angry and confused, as an increased number of black-clad marchers ended up in police custody. Portland’s neighborhoods have suffered from ongoing unrest since late May. Until late August, though, much of the violence and destruction was contained to Portland’s city center, with a federal courthouse as rioters’ top target. There, protesters tangled with an elite group of Customs and Border Protection Agents sent in to protect federal property. After the Department of Homeland Security withdrew their troops, protests moved to Portland’s residential neighborhoods, and Portland’s police department has been struggling to contain the unrest, often waiting until a demonstration becomes destructive before beginning the process of clearing streets and detaining individual marchers. Over the weekend, violence came to a head, protesters clashed with police and “dozens” were arrested “amid the protests in Portland included one juvenile and people from outside of Oregon, including California, Canada, Minnesota, Washington, and Texas, the Multnomah Co. Sheriff’s Office said Monday,” according to Fox News. The confrontations triggered Oregon’s Democrat Gov. Kate Brown to press Portland law enforcement to investigate “any alleged incidents” involving officers for signs of police brutality. Monday night, the Portland Police struck first, declaring a planned march to a police administration building “unlawful,” moving through the protesters’ camp, and confiscating materials typically used in riots. “Several dozen Portland police moved on protesters gathering in a North Portland park Monday night even before the group started marching,” Oregon Live reported Tuesday. “The armored officers swept through the park, confiscating homemade shields and other articles. A scuffle broke out when officers tried to confiscate a picket sign that read “vote,” multiple videos from the scene showed, and at least one person was detained. Police also deployed pepper spray.” The raid delayed the march and splintered it into smaller, more manageable factions. When demonstrators eventually regrouped, police immediately declared sidewalks and public roads off-limits. Eventually, Portland police declared the march an “unlawful assembly” and began arresting those suspected of inciting violence. “Twenty-four people were ultimately arrested. The vast majority are accused of interfering with a peace officer, disorderly conduct, or both charges,” Oregon Live added. Although the scene became chaotic, for the first time in several weeks, protesters were unable to set the police administration building on fire. Oregon Live notes that Portland police expect that all 24 individuals arrested will be back on the street Tuesday night, given that the Portland District Attorney will not prosecute protesters for small crimes like “interfering with a peace officer” or “disorderly conduct.” In some extreme cases, Oregon State Police, also involved in nightly crowed control, can refer certain protesters for Federal prosecution — as The Daily Wire earlier this month, the Oregon State Police were deputized by DHS — but those cases are rare.

In Minnesota, activists say they are prepared for the long fight against injustice. Protesters rallied at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday evening in a collective call for justice for Taylor’s family, and a conviction for former officer Brett Hankison. They are coming down the ramp closing highway 94 East in Saint Paul pic.twitter.com/9I2J3hg4y1 — Dymanh Chhoun (@Dymanh) September 24, 2020  Demonstrators then began marching down University Avenue, before dozens walked onto Interstate 94 in St. Paul after 8 p.m., closing both directions until about 8:40 p.m. (credit: CBS) Minnesota State Patrol squad cars were seen escorting small buses onto the highway, which may have been in preparation for arresting people who didn’t disperse. It is unclear as of late Wednesday night if anyone was taken into custody. After a day of protests in Louisville, rioters started setting fires in the streets at night. CBS News reports that two Louisville police officers were shot, but it is not clear if it was connected to the protests. The grand jury charged Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment. The charges against him were for shooting into neighboring apartments, not directly related to Taylor’s death. Louisville Police shot the 26-year-old EMT in March while executing a no-knock warrant at her apartment during a narcotics investigation. Taylor’s boyfriend fired one shot at police, saying he believed they were intruders. Three officers returned fire, killing Taylor. No drugs were ever found in her home. “The decision before my office as the special prosecutor in this case is not to decide if the loss of Miss Taylor’s life is a tragedy. The answer to that question unequivocally is yes,” Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said. Many in Minnesota, where George Floyd died while being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, say the grand jury’s decision to charge only one of the three officers involved is not justice for Taylor’s family. Some took to social media to express their concerns over the decision to charge Hankison, but not the other two officers, who still work for the Louisville Police Department. “I think it was a compromise … brought to bear by the protest and national protest, and they felt like they have to do something,” community activist Mel Reeves, who founded the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, said. “The whole thing is just a mess, and again it’s proof positive the system and the way that they do criminal justice is just wrong.” Reeves says it’s infuriating that the life of the aspiring nurse is not worth charging the people who he says are responsible for her death. “I think the other two people should have been charged with endangering her life as well, reckless endangerment of some kind,” Reeves said. He says activists across the country are digging in their heels, ready to take a stand against a system that he and others believe is not fair. For now they rally, march and try and change laws, seeking to create a system that has equal treatment for all. Last week, the city of Louisville agreed to pay Taylor’s family $12 million to settle a civil lawsuit, the most the city has ever paid in a police misconduct case. The mayor also pledged police reforms, including an overhaul of search warrant procedures. The family’s attorney called Wednesday’s decision outrageous and offensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kristina Narayan was arrested on Sunday around 2:07 a.m. Pacific time for interfering with a peace officer after the demonstration had been declared a riot and participants were ordered to clear the area, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. ""Kristina Narayan was arrested for Interfering with a Police Officer after the event became a riot and the crowd was given multiple orders to disperse, which she did not do,” said Officer Derek Carmon, a Portland Police Bureau spokesman, in a statement to the Hill. Narayan is the legislative director for Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek, according to a report from the Washington Free Beacon. Narayan has worked for Kotek, a Democrat, since 2016. Her LinkedIn account states that she has been a legislative director in the office since May 2018. Narayan is also listed as a legislative director on Kotek's official website. The Washington Examiner has reached out to Kotek's office for comment. At least 58 other people were arrested during the riot on Saturday night and Sunday morning, according to a press release from the Portland Police Bureau.

7850,https://www.businessinsider.com/asian-americans-against-trump-fundraiser-rallies-community-to-vote-2020-9,'Asian Americans Against Trump' fundraiser rallies community to vote,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since  Former Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang rallied Asian Americans to vote against Donald Trump in what he said could be a political gamechanger for the often overlooked community. ""If we get out in force and help Joe and Kamala win, this could be the major political awakening that Asian Americans have been waiting for a generation or more,"" Yang said Monday night in a virtual fundraiser for Asian Americans Against Trump. Yang was joined by prominent Asian American leaders and public figures, including Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna and Grace Meng, Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim, Pachinko author Min Jin Lee. The American entrepreneur said Asian Americans have been ""forced to become more engaged"" politically as they continue to suffer attacks from the ""hostility"" targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) community during the coronavirus pandemic. Many Asian Americans have been vulnerable to racist attacks, as President Donald Trump has used misleading and racist terms to describe the virus which experts said exacerbates microaggressions targeting the AAPI community. Yang said engaging with politics is a ""non-choice"" and an obligation for AAPI voters. ""We have to roll our sleeves up and do things we have not done as a community as high of a level as, frankly, people in other communities,"" Yang said. ""Our community can be the margin of victory and help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, our first Asian-American and Black woman vice president,"" NY Rep. Meng said. Asian American voters are the fastest-growing voting bloc with over 11 million eligible voters. California Rep. Khanna warned that ""anyone who thinks this election is not going to be very close, [is] underestimating Donald Trump's power to do everything possible to win. He's frankly mobilizing the power of the US government on behalf of his campaign"" and told Asian American voters that ""the only way we overcome that is by a massive turnout."" But to mobilize Asian American voters, the AAPI community must actively dispel the model minority myth, which is ""used by leaders to either be a wedge against other people of color or they are being used as some sort of pestilence,"" Lee said. Stereotyping Asian Americans as educated and hard-working, the model minority myth limits Asian Americans as people who are perfectly suited to be led, but not necessarily lead themselves. At the same time, the model minority myth does not capture the challenges that Asian Americans face and paints them under a monolithic narrative that is used as a wedge to pit them against other minorities. ""We still are in that place where we are expected to be the model minority, we are expected to be the ones who work hard, do really great work but never be the leaders,"" Kim said. ""If we can get the message out to other Asian Americans to have a say and a stake in the country where we live — we will be much more respected, much more powerful, and much more considered when it comes to the politics of our country.""

7888,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-protests-idUSKBN26A0EH,Biggest Thai protest in years cheers calls to reform monarchy,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Patpicha Tanakasempipat, Matthew Tostevin 4 Min Read BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people joined Thailand’s biggest protest in years on Saturday, cheering calls to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s monarchy and for the removal of former coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister. “Unless the monarchy is under the constitution, we will never achieve true democracy,” protest leader and human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa told the crowd gathered within sight of the Grand Palace in central Bangkok. “More, more,” the crowd chanted after Arnon called for cuts to the royal budget and changes to the constitution to bring the king clearly under its control. The Royal Palace was not available for comment on the protest and the demands for reform. “People can protest but they should do that peacefully and within the law,” said government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri when asked to comment. Arnon said protesters would on Sunday declare “the country belongs to the people, not the monarchy” and place a commemorative brass plaque, echoing the words of the leaders of the 1932 upheaval that ended absolute monarchy. Protests that have been building in the southeast Asian country of 70 million since mid-July have broken a long-standing taboo by criticising the monarchy as well as seeking a new constitution and elections. Related Coverage  Thai authorities have said criticising the monarchy is unacceptable in a country where the king is constitutionally “enthroned in a position of revered worship”. Lese majeste laws mean those insulting the monarchy can be jailed. “DON’T TALK ABOUT THE KING” Conservatives are horrified by attacks on the monarchy. “You can drive out the prime minister, but don’t talk about the king,” commented one Facebook user as speeches were broadcast live from the protest. Reuters reporters estimated there were at least 30,000 people in the demonstration. Organisers said there were more than 50,000, while police said there were 18,000, still enough to make it the biggest since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup. Protesters have said they plan to march to Government House on Sunday morning. The king was not in Thailand and has spent much of his time in Europe since taking the throne from his late father in 2016. Speakers at the protest criticised the king for his absence and for his personal behaviour, comments that until recently would not have been made in public. “The people are humans, not dust under your royal feet,” student leader Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul told the protest early on Sunday. “The people want a king who protects democracy, not one who betrays the people’s democracy.” The military, which proclaims itself the defender of the monarchy and national stability, has carried out several bloody crackdowns on protesters since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 as well as 13 successful coups. Sept. 19 is the anniversary of the coup against the populist then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006. Among the protesters were many of his red shirt followers, veterans of clashes a decade ago with pro-establishment yellow shirts. “I’m here to fight for the future of my children and grandchildren. I hope that by the time I die, they will become free,” said 68-year-old Tasawan Suebthai, a redshirt with amulets round her neck which she hoped would ward off bullets. The latest protests have been peaceful so far, but more than a dozen protest leaders have been arrested and released on bail. None has been charged under the lese majeste laws which protesters want scrapped. They also seek to reduce the king’s constitutional powers and his control over the palace fortune and units of the army.

(File) Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who was accompanying the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died after being gang raped in Uttar Pradesh, from Delhi to Hathras said on Wednesday that he was detained by Uttar Pradesh police midway and has now been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. ""The whole world saw how our sister was cremated at night in the absence of the family and without their consent, in connivance of the government and the police. The morality of these people is dead. I was detained by their police the night before and now I have been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. But we will fight,"" Mr Azad tweeted in Hindi. He also shared a picture of the notice issued to him by the Saharanpur police, which stated: ""You are being informed that CrPC section 144 is imposed in the district. There are credible inputs that your tours and acts are gathering crowds, which may lead to law and order situation. Any untoward incident may happen. Hence, you are being informed that you will stay in your house only."" The order, issued by the local Fatehpur police station in-charge Manoj Chaudhary, also warned Mr Azad of legal action for violating the instruction. Mr Chaudhary said it was not a ""house arrest"" but Mr Azad has been asked to remain at his home in view of the law and order situation. ""There is no time limit on the order as such,"" he added. According to functionaries of the Azad Samaj Party, which was launched by the Bhim Army chief in March, Azad and Delhi unit head Himanshu Balmiki had gone missing after 10 pm on Tuesday while they were on their way to Hathras, accompanying the family of the woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday. The Azad Samaj Party and affiliates of the pro-Dalit Bhim Army, among others, had joined the protests outside Safdarjung hospital in the national capital on Tuesday to demand justice for the gangrape victim and her family. ""There is no clue about the location of Chandrashekhar Azad and Himanshu almiki after they reached the Jewar toll plaza to get on the lane to Tappal, Aligarh,"" Azad Samaj Party's core committee member Ravindra Bhati said earlier on Wednesday. He alleged that Mr Azad and Himanshu Balmiki were detained during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, but the police were not making it public. The body of the woman was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family members alleging that the local police forced them to perform the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, said that the victim was cremated ""according to the wishes of the family"". Around 12:30 pm on Wednesday, dozens of Azad Samaj Party and Bhim Army activists reached the Tappal police station in Aligarh and staged a demonstration. ""A delegation of our representatives will be meeting senior police and administration officials to inquire about Azad and Balmiki,"" Bhati told the protesters inside the Tappal police station compound. A senior Aligarh police official said: ""I have no idea about this (detention) claim.""  The district police chief and some other senior officers could not be contacted as according to another police official, they have been infected with the coronavirus and are under medication for the last three-four days.

7927,https://www.yahoo.com/huffpost/black-lives-matter-protests-nonviolent-152841166.html,"Over 93% Of Protests This Summer Were Peaceful, Report Finds","The overwhelming majority of demonstrations this summer were peaceful, according to a new report, which also warns that the upcoming election and President Donald Trump’s incendiary rhetoric — which has placed an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests — could plunge the country into further crisis. The report, published Thursday, is from the U.S. Crisis Monitor, a collaboration between the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which collects and analyzes real-time data on protest movements, using news reports, social media and other sources. “These data reveal that the United States is in crisis. It faces a multitude of concurrent, overlapping risks — from police abuse and racial injustice, to pandemic-related unrest and beyond — all exacerbated by increasing polarization,” the researchers wrote, warning that “these intersecting risks are likely to intensify” as the November election draws closer. The report covers data gathered on protests between May 24, the day before police in Minneapolis killed George Floyd, and Aug. 22. During that period, the researchers collected more than 10,600 demonstration events across the country, with more than 7,750 of them related to the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests peaked in late May and early June, and while they have leveled off since, activists in many places across the country continue to hold largely peaceful demonstrations every day. The overwhelming majority of the protests — more than 10,100 — involved peaceful protesters, the researchers found. In only about 5%, or under 570 of the protests, did participants engage in violence. “The vast majority of demonstration events associated with the BLM movement are non-violent,” the researchers wrote. “In more than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement, demonstrators have not engaged in violence or destructive activity.” In the protests that became violent, they either involved state-sanctioned violence, such as violent intervention from local, state or federal authorities, or counterprotesters from extremist groups. The police or military “disproportionately used force while intervening in demonstrations associated with the BLM movement, relative to other types of demonstrations,” the researchers found. According to their data, in nearly 10% of BLM protests recorded this summer, police violently intervened by deploying tear gas, rubber bullets and/or pepper spray, as well as assaulting protesters with batons. During this period, the researchers also found an uptick in “government violence against journalists,” collecting over 100 separate incidents in at least 31 states and the District of Columbia. As for why public opinion polling suggests that people think a disproportionate number of the protests were violent when in fact they were not, the report attributes those perceptions to respondents’ existing political views, media coverage of violent protests and disinformation campaigns on social media. The report stresses the gravity of the situation, as the sources of this uprising — from racial inequities, to continued police violence, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic — are continuing. It warns that the upcoming election and Trump’s consistent attempts to sow discord and cast doubt on the election results will exacerbate these forces, citing “multiple steps to inflame these tensions” from Trump and his administration. Trump has made much of his re-election campaign about “law and order,” with an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests, racist appeals to white voters and false conspiracy theories about voting by mail. “In this hyper-polarized environment, state forces are taking a more heavy-handed approach to dissent, non-state actors are becoming more active and assertive, and counter-demonstrators are looking to resolve their political disputes in the street,” the researchers wrote. “Without significant mitigation efforts, these risks will continue to intensify in the lead-up to the vote, threatening to boil over in November if election results are delayed, inconclusive, or rejected as fraudulent.” Read the full report here.

7929,https://www.breitbart.com/news/portland-protests-reach-100-consecutive-days-this-weekend/,"BLM rallies, memorial for man killed in Portland shooting - Breitbart","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — People gathered for Black Lives Matter rallies Saturday evening in Portland, Oregon, and a memorial was held for the man fatally shot last weekend after a right-wing caravan went through downtown, as daily demonstrations stretched well past the three-month mark in the city. Hundreds of people gathered in a park just north of Portland in Vancouver, Washington, for a memorial service for Aaron “Jay” Danielson, a supporter of a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer, who was killed Aug. 29. The suspect was himself shot and killed by police Thursday. Families showed up at the event with their kids, lining up for the free BBQ and picnicking on the grass at Esther Short Park. As various speakers addressed the audience on stage, attendees waved their flags enthusiastically, occasionally breaking out into chants of “U-S-A!” Many of the crowd were President Donald Trump supporters, wearing MAGA hats and shirts or holding Trump-Pence flags. Some also waved flags and wore T-shirts showing support for the police. Some attendees also wore T-shirts with “Justice for J” that were handed out at the event. Several local members of Proud Boys, a far-right group that has been involved in skirmishes at local protests, attended. “We honor a man who died for what he believed in,” said James Johnson, who has been a member of the Proud Boys for two years. Johnson, who is Black, said he disagreed with people who label the group as a white supremacist organization. The crowded regularly erupted in boos with any mention of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, whom Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson demanded apologize to Danielson’s family because they felt he had been unfairly portrayed. “This is about truth and lies,” Gibson said. “Jay was not a white supremacist.” Authorities released additional court documents late Friday detailing the moments before Danielson’s slaying. The documents included shots of security footage that showed the suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, ducked into a parking garage and reached toward a pocket or pouch at his waist before emerging to follow the victim. Danielson was holding bear spray and an expandable baton and had a loaded Glock handgun in a holster at his waist, according to the documents. Authorities have said they believe Reinoehl, who was fatally shot by law enforcement officers late Thursday in Washington state, killed Danielson. Witnesses told police that just before they heard gunshots someone said something like, “wanna go,” which is frequently a challenge to a fight. Danielson, 39, was shot in the chest and died at the scene. The court documents were filed to support second-degree murder charges against Reinoehl, who was a supporter of antifa — shorthand for anti-fascists and an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events. Demonstrations in Portland started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. They have often been marked by vandalism and violence. Black Lives Matter rallies were taking place in the city Saturday evening and night, and BLM supporters drove vehicles through the city earlier Saturday. At one event Saturday afternoon, people stenciled names on a pathway of Black people killed by police. Late Friday protests continued into early Saturday in Portland, with police declaring an unlawful assembly and arresting 27 people. A few hundred demonstrators had met at Kenton Park Friday before making their way to the Portland Police Association building, where officers warned protesters to stay off the streets and private property. Those who refused could be subject to citation, arrest, the use of tear gas, crowd-control agents or impact munitions, police said. The Portland Police Bureau issued a statement Saturday morning saying some officers reported that rocks, a full beverage can and water bottles had been thrown at them, prompting police to declare the gathering an unlawful assembly. Police said one woman who was detained was bleeding from an abrasion on her head, and she was treated by medics at the scene before being transported by an ambulance. The Portland Police Bureau said she jumped out of the ambulance and ran away before it left the scene, however. Most of those arrested were arrested on suspicion of interfering with a peace officer or disorderly conduct, police said. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Michael Forest Reinoehl was killed by law enforcement officers, not federal agents. ___ Ding reported from Vancouver, Washington.  .

7955,https://www.dailywire.com/news/democrats-praise-peaceful-protests-as-violent-riots-that-are-trumps-fault-satire,Democrats Praise Peaceful Protests As Violent Riots That Are Trump’s Fault [Satire] | The Daily Wire,"CNN is now reporting that the mostly peaceful demonstrations for racial justice are all Donald Trump’s fault because they’re violent riots serving no purpose at all. In the cable network’s latest news show, Preposterous Sources, a Volkswagen pulls up and dozens of CNN commentators amazingly yet hilariously pour out onto the set and begin denouncing Trump for the violence that isn’t happening in the mostly peaceful cities that are burning down for some reason that is Trump’s fault. After gleefully honking his red rubber nose, Don Lemon told his viewer, “Let me pretend to be clear. These cities you see where innocent people are brutalized — this is Donald Trump’s America — or at least those parts of Donald Trump’s America that are governed by Democrats and that’s why they’re mostly peaceful.” “And I’m very serious about this as you can tell from the faint moistness in my eyes, which I feel gives me the sensitive look of a graceful doe in a peaceful forest glade,” Lemon added. “But perhaps that’s beside the point.” Joe Biden has also emerged from his basement to praise the mostly peaceful protests that are actually riots that are Trump’s fault, so he denounces them. Speaking to a broom closet he mistook for a meeting of very thin people re-enacting the Bride of Frankenstein, Biden said, “C’mon, man! These are people. When I look at them I see the whole history of a kind of thing that we need to do better because do I look like someone who would support radical leftists like my good friend Bernie Sanders or my running mate Kamala Harris? I mean, who do you think I am?” “No really, who DO you think I am, because I can’t remember,” Biden said. “And while you’re at it, where do you think I live, because I’d like to get back in the basement.” Biden then declared victory in the election and resigned the presidency, which would make Kamala Harris the first woman of color ever to become president in an old man’s imagination.

7991,https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/spd-watchdog-sergeant-did-not-intentionally-target-boy-with-pepper-spray-protest/GWTNKOCN7ZBSVDGXMXKX5MTZE4/,SPD watchdog: Sergeant did not intentionally target boy with pepper spray at protest,"SEATTLE — Investigators with Seattle’s Office of Police Accountability say officers did not intentionally target a young boy when they hit him in the face with pepper spray during a protest. Video of the boy crying, with milk running down his face to lessen the effects of the spray, went viral after the May 30 protest and led to 13,000 complaints filed with OPA. According to an OPA description released Friday, “(The boy) and his father moved towards a protester who had grabbed an officer’s baton and was pushing into the police line. An SPD supervisor used pepper spray to move the protester back. In response, the protester ducked, causing the pepper spray to inadvertently affect the boy and his father.” >>RAW: Family of 7-year-old who was pepper-sprayed during Seattle protest speaks out OPA investigators found the sergeant who used the spray followed SPD policy in response to the protester’s actions, and investigators say their review of the body cameras worn by officers showed the sergeant was not able to see the child. After the incident, many people on social media claimed to identify the officer who used the pepper spray. Scroll down to continue reading But OPA investigators found the complainants identified the wrong officer, and that the pepper spraying was actually done by a sergeant. In another incident caught on camera, OPA investigators found an officer’s use of force was “improper and inconsistent with SPD policy and training” when he placed his knee on a person’s neck during an arrest for 13 seconds. That case is currently before Interim Chief Adrian Diaz for discipline. OPA received a total of 19,000 complaints regarding officer conduct during protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Most of the complaints referred to the same incidents and the civilian-led oversight office is currently reviewing about 100 cases. The following statement was released on behalf of the Avery family, whose boy was pepper sprayed: “We are deeply disappointed, but not surprised, by the result reached by the OPA. Today, they have confirmed that it is the Seattle Police Department’s position that the use of pepper spray in an intentional and reckless manner that it would strike an innocent child exercising their First Amendment rights is “within policy.” We understand the OPA has said it is “sorry” for these actions. But “sorry” and “regret” is not sufficient. We demand change. OPA did not address the whether the officers could have ta steps to prevent this from happening and, even further, no police officers attempted to render aid to the child making any apology tough to accept. Moreover, the OPA reached its conclusions by analysis and discussion of body camera footage—tapes that were not provided to the family or their legal counsel before today. The OPA’s also refuses to identify the officers who used force in this incident. All of this undermines the claims of objectivity and transparency that the City purports to value. We continue to demand change, and this confirms that it is still deeply needed because the City of Seattle continues to remain indifferent to the suffering its police, and other City officials, have caused to black and indigenous people of color for decades, including the Avery family.” More news from KIRO 7 DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP Cox Media Group © 2021 Cox Media Group.

8117,https://www.vox.com/2020/10/31/21543277/trump-rallies-covid-19-deaths-superspreader-stanford-study-infections,"Trump rallies may be responsible for roughly 700 Covid-19 deaths, study finds","The president is most likely a superspreader. A study conducted by four Stanford University economic researchers determined that 18 Trump campaign rallies, the bulk of which took place over the past summer, “ultimately resulted in more than 30,000 incremental confirmed cases of COVID-19” and “likely led to more than 700 deaths.” The study examined 18 counties that hosted Trump rallies in locations such as Tulsa, Oklahoma; Phoenix, Arizona; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina, held between June 20 and September 22. It then compared the rate of post-rally Covid-19 infections in the host counties to that of comparable counties that did not host a rally. Attendance at individual rallies varied, but Trump often draws thousands of supporters to these events. “For the vast majority of county matching procedures we employ,” the authors wrote, “our estimate of the average treatment effect across the eighteen rallies implies that they increased subsequent confirmed cases of COVID-19 by more than 250 per 100,000 residents.” The researchers — B. Douglas Bernheim, an economics professor at Stanford, and Stanford grad students Nina Buchmann, Zach Freitas-Groff, and Sebastián Otero — extrapolated that figure to the entire sample, concluding that the rallies led to thousands of new infections and, likely, hundreds of deaths. As the authors acknowledge, trying to identify exactly how many infections resulted from a Trump rally (or any other potential superspreader event) is not easy. Factors such as whether the rally is held indoor or outdoor, whether a large number of infected people attended, whether attendees wore masks, and “the distribution of infected individuals among rally attendees” can all lead to vastly different rates of infection. Likewise, while the authors estimate Trump’s summer rallies led to more than 700 deaths, they note those deaths were “not necessarily among attendees.” For example, a rally-goer may become infected with a mild case, but that same rally-goer might give the virus to his wife, who gives it to a coworker, who gives it to their sister, who dies of Covid-19. Nevertheless, the average discrepancies between the number of infections in counties hosting Trump rallies and the infection rates in other, similar counties suggest that at least some of Trump’s campaign events were superspreader events, potentially responsible for hundreds of lost lives. Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that Trump was “asking for trouble” by hosting mass political rallies as the number of Covid-19 infections surge. But Fauci’s warning does not appear to have deterred the president, who reportedly plans to host 14 rallies in the final three days of the 2020 campaign. ntribute today from as little as $3.

8252,https://www.ladbible.com/news/uk-marcus-rashford-proud-of-support-for-free-holiday-meals-campaign-20201024,Marcus Rashford Rallies Communities Across Country To Provide Free Meals Over School Holidays,"Published 10:32, 24 October 2020 BST| Last updated 10:37, 24 October 2020 BST It's been another fairly standard week for Marcus Rashford. Last Saturday he was bagging against Newcastle, on Tuesday he scored the winner against Paris Saint Germain, and since returning to British soil he has been working tirelessly to help feed disadvantaged children during half term. On Thursday, MPs voted against a motion to extend free school meals during the half term break amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But Manchester United and England forward Rashford - or Rashford MBE as we should now call him - did not give up the fight. As well as mucking in to lend a hand at the FareShare warehouse with his mum, the 22-year-old has also been helming a movement on Twitter. Using the hashtag #endchildfoodpoverty, he collated pubs, restaurants and cafes across the country that are stepping up to offer free meals during the half term break. After going at it all day yesterday (23 October), Rashford said he was knocking off with a feeling of 'pride'. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: ""Growing up we didn't have a lot, but we always had the safety net of the community. That community was my family. When we stumbled, we were caught with open arms. ""Even at their lowest point, having felt the devastating effects of the pandemic, local businesses have wrapped arms around their communities today, catching vulnerable children as they fell. ""I couldn't be more proud to call myself British tonight. I am truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. ""You want to talk about 'celebrities' and 'superstars', look no further than my Twitter feed and that's exactly what you'll find."" He's not wrong either - here's just a handful of places that are helping out:  If you head to his Twitter feed you will find many more. In Scotland and Wales, governments have extended free meals during school holidays until Easter, while in Northern Ireland they'll be provided over the half-term break this month. A number of councils in England, including those in Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, have also agreed to supply disadvantaged pupils with vouchers. McDonald's is also partnering with FareShare to offer one million free meals.

One person was shot and killed, and a local news station's private security guard was in custody Saturday evening after protests between opposing groups turned violent in Denver's Civic Center Park, city police said. ***Must Credit: @rustyyyyy69 via Storyful*** The man who was shot was part of a pro-police ""Patriot Rally,"" according to a report. ""Further investigation has determined the suspect is a private security guard with no affiliation with Antifa,"" the Denver Police Department wrote in a Twitter message. Matthew Dolloff Courtesy Denver Police/ Twitter KUSA-TV, a local Denver news station also known as 9NEWS, reported that a suspect in police custody was a private security guard hired by the station. ""The private security guard was contracted through Pinkerton by 9NEWS,"" the news outlet wrote. ""It has been the practice of 9NEWS for a number of months to hire private security to accompany staff at protests."" A KUSA producer also was initially in custody, but has since been released. ***Must Credit: @rustyyyyy69 via Storyful*** WISCONSIN PROTESTERS FACE 'HEAVY DOSE OF TEAR GAS, PEPPER BALLS' Video of the incident shows one shot being fired. Denver police then quickly cordon off the scene, giving medical aid to the victim and arresting a suspect. ""There was a verbal altercation that transpired. A firearm was discharged,"" Joe Montoya, Denver Police chief of investigations said. ""An individual was shot and later pronounced deceased. There were two guns recovered at the scene."" The shooting victim had participated in a pro-police rally, the Denver Post reported. ""The incident occurred after a man participating in what was billed a 'Patriot Rally' sprayed mace at another man. That man then shot the other individual with a handgun near the courtyard outside the Denver Art Museum,"" the newspaper reported. Denver police said they had one suspect in custody and were investigating the incident as a homicide. Police had a large presence at the protests to keep opposing protesters calm. ""There was a large presence because we had two groups with opposing views, and we know that can always get very tense,"" Montoya said. ""There’s always potential for violence, we understand that. We had a large contingent there to try to watch the egress of one group, so that the other group wouldn’t intermingle with them, so that’s the reason for the large presence there."" One side of the protests was characterized as a ""Black Lives Matter Anti-Fascist Soup Drive"" on Facebook.

8347,https://www.channelstv.com/2020/10/11/breaking-inspector-general-of-police-scraps-sars/,[UPDATED] IGP Dissolves SARS After Widespread Protests,"CHANNELS TELEVISION Advertisement   The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has dissolved the infamous subunit of the force, the Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS). “The Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian Police, otherwise known as SARS, is hereby dissolved across all formations, the 36 state police command and the Federal Capital Territory where they currently exist,” the IGP said on Sunday. “All officers and men currently serving in the unit are to be redeployed with immediate effect.” The police authorities will be announcing new policing arrangements to address the offences of armed robbery and other violent crimes that fall within the mandate of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad later. Adamu’s announcement followed days of widespread protests by Nigerians demanding scrapping of the unit which had gained notoriety for brutality and human rights violations.   Beyond scrapping the unit, he acknowledged reports of extortion and brutality, announcing a plan for an investigation. “To deal with the reports of crimes committed against citizens an investigation team will be constituted which will include civil society organisations for transparency and the culprits will be punished,” he said.  Read Also: #EndSars: Young Nigerian Jimoh Isiaq Killed In Ogbomosho, Seven Others Injured     The IGP did not give details of the time range the investigation will cover and whether it would include the harassment, threats and violence protesters suffered during the #EndSARS protest, including the killing of a young Nigerian Jimoh Isiaq in Ogbomoso on Saturday. Witnesses said Isiaq was shot by the police. In contrast with the action of the police including the use of tear gas on protesters and the shooting witnessed, the IGP described the protests “as a manifestation of the natural desires of citizens to participate in matters concerning policing and internal security in the nation”. To better relations between the public and the police, the IGP also announced “a citizens and strategic (stake)holders forum will be formed to regularly interface with the leadership of the police at all levels and advice on police activities”.  #IGPDissolvesSARS pic.twitter.com/A1TvvefbOu — Nigeria Police Force (@PoliceNG) October 11, 2020    The unit was founded in 1992 to combat cases of armed robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes. But SARS, instead, over time, has gained notoriety for its reckless intimidation of innocent civilians through puerile profiling and wanton abuse of power. Calls for the unit’s disbandment date as far back as 2017 and while the Federal Government and police chiefs have made several pledges to implement reforms, reports of SARS’ brutal activities against civilians have not abated. The current wave of protest can be traced to October 3, after another report of extra-judicial killing in Delta State (the police have denied any killing took place). It sparked fresh concerns and anger. Fuelled by this, and the outpouring of tales of traumatic experiences at the hands of officials of the unit, many Nigerians have held protests in many states, including Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory, Kaduna, Osun, Edo, and Imo.   RELATED LIVE: #EndSARS Protests Continue, Gain Momentum #EndSARS: Reps Unveil 30-Day Plan To Tackle Police Brutality   The Speaker House of Representatives, Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, has also unveiled some of the plans by the House, aimed at tackling police brutality in the country. In a statement signed personally on Wednesday, Gbajabiamila said over the next 30 days, the House will work with the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), civil society and with Nigerians of good conscience to draft new legislation that establishes a system of independent accountability from the Force. According to him, the new legislation will hold erring members of the Police Force to account for their conduct in the performance of their duties and impose civil and criminal liability for violations of the Police Code. It will also compel the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to take responsibility for the failures of training and discipline that leads to such violations. Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carmen Lerma, 52, wants to share her story to educate others. Lerma is hospitalized at UW Health in Madison and is on the organ donation list, waiting to receive a double-lung transplant. She contracted coronavirus in July and spent over a month and a half in intensive care. Even though Lerma did not have any underlying medical conditions, doctors say her lungs suffered irreversible damage. “That was a hard pill to swallow, because I'm like: ‘Wait, what? What do you mean?’ And they said, ‘Your lungs are not going to get any better unless we do this,’” she told Milwaukee's NBC affiliate TMJ4 News. On Monday, she was set to undergo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, a form of life support that essentially takes the place of the heart and lungs, according to the American Thoracic Society. She hasn’t been able to see visitors for three months. Lerma is director for events and community outreach at United Migrant Opportunity Services (UMOS), a nonprofit advocacy organization providing programs and services to under-served populations. “If you think that this virus is a simple flu or that it’s not as bad as it’s seems to be ... listen to my story carefully you will learn the struggle,” Lerma wrote on Facebook. “I miss my family, but I get strength in thinking of them” Lerma said. In Milwaukee, the community is rallying behind her to help with medical expenses. Don Cohen, vice president of community development at Landmark Credit Union in the Milwaukee area, has worked with Lerma for years, partnering with UMOS on a variety of community events. Cohen and Victor Huyke, the owner of El Conquistador, a Latino newspaper, knew Lerma was really worried about the hospital expenses. In response, they created a GoFundMe page that has raised over $27,614 as of Monday afternoon. “This really has taken a huge load off her mind,” Cohen told NBC News in an email. A fundraiser has also been scheduled for Thursday, which will include raffles and live performances. Across the Midwest, coronavirus cases are surging. Wisconsin reported over 3,861 new coronavirus cases on Friday and the state now ranks fourth in a seven-day tally of new cases. Nationwide, more than 220,000 people in the United States have died of Covid-19, according to an NBC News tracker. Carmen Hernandez, 47, has volunteered with Lerma in the past and says ""everyone"" in Milwaukee knows her. Whether it's helping low-income families pay off their utility bills or handing out backpacks with school supplies, Lerma is a welcoming face in the community. “She is very kind. She is very loved,” said Hernandez by phone. “I feel so bad for her situation right now. She can’t even breathe. … It’s really hard for me to see her going through this when she’s such an active person.” Hernandez said she plans to contribute to the raffle. “I want to raise that money to give to her surgery. We need to do something for her because she has been helping us,” she said. “Right now, she needs us.” Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The Stanford University paper took a close look at 18 Trump rallies between June and September and followed subjects “up to ten post-rally weeks for each event.” “The communities in which Trump rallies took place paid a high price in terms of disease and death,” researchers concluded in the paper released Friday.. Rates of COVID-19 often rose notably in communities that hosted the events, compared to nearby towns where Trump stayed away, the study found. “There are some indications that compliance with public health guidelines, such as the use of masks, improved at later rallies,” researchers wrote. Researchers need more data to study whether better compliance with public health guidelines prevented sickness and saved lives requires more data, the Stanford paper said. The Trump campaign has insisted that it offers participants masks and temperature checks at the president’s rallies.

So you can release some esoteric 17-minute song about the Kennedy assassination in goddamn March and call it a day? We’re still droning people in half a dozen countries, for Christ’s sake. Look, you have a lot of options here—some sparsely instrumented yet grand statement that perfectly summarizes the current maelstrom of blame and chaos like ‘Blowin’ In The Wind’ or ‘The Times They Are A-Changin’’ would be ideal, obviously, but if you would rather hone in on some specific episode of social injustice that serves as a microcosm of a commentary on systemic issues, like ‘Hurricane’ or ‘The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll,’ that works too. Your lyrics don’t even rhyme. All you have to do is sit down with a guitar and just poignantly and pointedly attack the actions of the Trump administration, or really any other aspect of our present moment. It’s not like we’re lacking for subject matter. Jesus, Bob, get your shit together.” Sources added that they would give Dylan the rest of the month to release something as galvanizing and timelessly true as “Masters Of War.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8694,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/14/politics/white-house-task-force-small-gatherings/index.html,Task force warns against small gatherings as Trump rallies with thousands,"The White House coronavirus task force expressed concern about virus spread stemming from small household gatherings as coronavirus cases rise across the country and colder months approach. The warnings come as President Donald Trump continues ignoring precautions as he gathers thousands of mostly maskless supporters at rallies across the country in the final sprint before the election. Mitigation efforts – wearing a mask, social distancing – in retail settings such as stores and restaurants are working, the task force suggested in its weekly report released to states Tuesday. But the same precautions aren’t being taken as smaller groups of friends and family gather in private home settings, which could be cause for alarm ahead of the winter months and the Thanksgiving holiday. “What we’re seeing as the increasing threat right now is actually acquisition of infection through small household gatherings. And particularly with Thanksgiving coming up, we think it’s really important to stress the vigilance of these continued mitigation steps in the household setting,” US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield told the nation’s governors in a conference call Tuesday, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN.  That messaging was communicated in reports released from the task force to each state this week. The White House has declined to make the reports public but CNN has obtained reports from several states. For example, reports for Vermont, Washington and Delaware warned against community transmission “in smaller gatherings of family and friends where masking and social distancing recommendations are not followed,” recommending “increased messaging regarding the need to take these measures, especially given the element of prevention ‘fatigue.’” The task force warned New Mexico that “people must remember that seemingly uninfected family members and friends may be infected but asymptomatic,” which “can easily lead to spread as people unmask in private gatherings.” And the task force told Pennsylvania and Utah: “Recent data suggest that smaller, more intimate gatherings of family, friends and neighbors are driving infection, especially as activities move indoors and adherence to face covering and social distancing wanes.” Based on the reports obtained by CNN, there are at least 26 states in the task force-defined “red zone” for new cases, meaning more than 100 new cases per 100,000 population. A report for Vermont reflected that no state is currently in the task force-defined “green zone” for cases. With between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population, Vermont, which has the “lowest rate in the country,” now falls into the “yellow zone.” The task force also sounded the alarms about the possibility of an outbreak in the Northeast region. Vermont has been “extraordinarily successful,” the task force said, but added there is still cause for concern. The task force warned Ohio and New Mexico of reemerging spread, telling Ohio it is “showing early signs of reemergence of significant community spread.” Utah, home to the fifth-highest new case rate in the nation, was warned that the state’s “incidence and test positivity are the highest they have ever been, but restrictions are low to minimal across the state.” “Clear mitigation policies with effective implementation are critically important, especially in areas with increasing incidence,” the Utah report said. Idaho, which has the sixth-highest new case rate, was told to have schools take steps to avoid what it described as “Covid-19 stigma.” They included: “(Addressing) Covid-19 stigma related to responsibility for school closing by emphasizing consequences of Covid-19 (morbidity and mortality), posting hospitalization and mortality data on local and state websites, posting local trends in incidence and test positivity by age group (to show how transmission starts in the young and expands to older populations) and encouraging community cohesion and civic responsibility in local messaging.” The task force encouraged Idaho school districts to “deploy specific messaging on COVID-19 risks and strategies to avoid infection targeted to older individuals and those at risk for more severe disease.” And in Missouri, which still does not have a statewide mask mandate in place, the task force said community spread continues, in both rural and urban settings. “Mitigation efforts should increase to include mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding crowds in public and social gatherings in private to stop the increasing spread among residents of Missouri,” the report said. The task force also cautioned that there are “severe outbreaks” among nursing home residents and staff in Missouri. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

Using the #EndSWAT hashtag on the social media platform, Twitter, the protesters believe the new arm of the police would be no different from the disbanded SARS.

""I don't even know what this is. This is really confusing,"" said D.C. correspondent Cork Dorgen. ""We've seen violent protests and mostly-peaceful protests, but this protest seems all-the-way peaceful and we didn't even know that was a thing."" According to witnesses, a crowd of hundreds of thousands of people peacefully marched while waving flags, singing the National Anthem, and proclaiming their love for the country and the president. Media outlets in turn have condemned the march as ""physically peaceful, but morally violent."" According to several reports, demonstrators were seen wearing shirts with violent and triggering patriotic messages. One reporter witnessed a high-schooler in a MAGA hat smirking very violently at him. ""While we didn't see physical violence here today, we heard violent speech, violent ideas, and violent singing. These people are basically violent,"" said CNN reporter Jim Acosta. ""If they are not stopped, they may violently stop watching news from trusted sources like CNN or violently expose corruption in Joe Biden's administration."" Reporters were even more horrified when it was revealed that 92% of the crowd was planning to violently attend church services and violently sing hymns the next day in spite of the pandemic.

They will be destroyed because America is rising.” “You’ve awakened the sleeping giant,” Jones said, before naming a list of figures—Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci—who should “burn in hell.” The protest was otherwise mostly quiet in comparison to Wednesday, when the office was shut down and the media asked to leave as an angry mob of pro-Trump demonstrators, some of them armed, rallied outside of the office. On Thursday, sheriff’s deputies reportedly asked the crowd to move off the streets, and then demonstrators prayed for a “fair and honest election.” As the Arizona vote has continued to be counted to determine the state’s 11 electoral votes, Trump has drastically cut into Biden’s once-sizable lead. A big drop of newly counted votes in Maricopa and other counties cut Biden’s advantage to 48,000 votes, although the Associated Press and Fox News have not retracted their election-night calls that Biden won the state. Ultimately, it may be moot—Biden has taken the lead in Georgia and now Pennsylvania, according to CNN, which would seal an Electoral College victory.

The proposed ‘epidemic law’ would have replaced an existing emergency law passed in the spring which gave the government sweeping powers to fight Covid-19, but protests lasting nine days have seen the radical measures which politicians hoped to make permanent shelved for now despite the emergence of two possible Covid-19 vaccines. https://twitter.com/robinmonotti/status/1327588831659483137 With the assistance of police, the epidemic law would have allowed forced vaccinations of people from defined groups that refuse the vaccine, as well as forcible medical examinations and detention in isolation centres. https://twitter.com/robinmonotti/status/1327862076694474752 “The Danish Health Authority would be able to define groups of people who must be vaccinated in order to contain and eliminate a dangerous disease,” reports the Local. “People who refuse the above can – in some situations – be coerced through physical detainment, with police allowed to assist.” The Danish Medical Association (DMA) were among other groups calling for the law to be dropped by legislators. “We think these are regulations that go too far and ought to be changed,” Camilla Rathcke, director of the DMA told Danish news outlet DR, adding that such power would be “overstepping boundaries”. The law would also have left the decision about which diseases merit such force solely in the hands of the health minister. “We don’t suspect a minister to have bad intentions. But decisions on emergency situations need broad parliamentary support,” Anders Beich, head of the Danish College of General Practitioners, told DR.

With her vibrant pink hair and signature specs, Seraphine is about as unique as they come in terms of Champions. If a fictional character was based on you, we're pretty sure you'd know about it - but when it comes to ""Stephanie"", she thinks the character has stolen her likeness. Posting on Medium, Stephanie explained her personal journey and why Seraphine is a problematic newcomer to LoL. The crux of the matter goes back to Stephanie's brief relationship with a Riot Games employee in 2019. She's confident this led to her likeness being used to create the K/DA pop princess. In the lengthy story, Stephanie spoke about her relationship with ""John"". She explained, the pair had a mutual love of LoL, while John came up with Stephanie-inspired skin ideas for her favourite character, Ahri. She said she visited the Riot Games studio and was given artist drawings of herself as Ahri, which she said was ""strange"". She continued to claim John wanted her to provide the voice for a top-secret project which she thinks was Seraphine. Despite her and John going their separate ways, Stephanie said she was shocked to see Seraphine's reveal (which was also the same day as her birthday). Stephanie said, ""As soon as I saw what she looked like and realised she was going to be a League champion, I started scrolling through her accounts, completely freaked out. My worries only grew, and my heart sank more and more with every post"". Stephanie went on to point out how a lot of her poses seem to match Seraphine and how she thinks her cat was the inspiration for Seraphine's. Instead of putting the blame at John's door, she's instead pointing at Riot. She concluded, ""It's a quaint idea, but when you think about it more closely, the idea of a marketing team in some office in Los Angeles trying to sell a product by coming up with the most ~relatable~ and marketable things to tweet out of the account of a 'girl' who coincidentally looks like me, and talks like me, and sounds like me, and draws like me? It just makes me sick"". Despite having ""no way to conclusively prove"" Seraphine is based on her, Stephanie is standing by her story. Is there more to this twisted tale though? Stephanie's accusations have caught the attention of Riot Games, which has now issued a statement on the matter.  Despite some thinking there's a lot to Stephanie's claims, Riot maintains there's nothing untoward going on. A Riot spokesperson told PC Gamer, ""Seraphine was independently created by Riot Games and was not based on any individual. Additionally, the former employee [Stephanie] is referring to left Riot more than a year ago and was in a department and role that has no input whatsoever into the creative design process"". In October, Senior Game Designer Jeevun Sidhu cited that his wife was the main influence for Seraphine. Also, last month, Stephanie's lawyer sent a legal demand to Riot Games. The defence has said Stephanie's claim “lacks merit” and has invited her side to “further discuss the facts"". While Stephanie thinks Seraphine is based on her, Riot is sticking to its guns and is adamant this is just a simple coincidence.

Chicago Mayor Defends Street Protests, Celebrations While Canceling Thanksgiving | Sean Hannity","Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot faced a growing backlash from Chicago residents this week after defending her decision to attend a pro-Biden street rally while telling her city’s inhabitants to stay home and avoid crowds this Thanksgiving. “What do you say to those who are criticizing you for standing before a massive crowd, now you’re saying your city has to shut down?” asked a reporter with MSNBC. “We’ve been saying all along that everybody has to take precaution. That crowd was gathered whether I was there or not!” said Lightfoot. Watch the Mayor’s comments above. At least 13 people were injured in a series of shootings across Chicago that left 2 people dead in less than 24 hours; raising even more questions over security in the nation’s third largest metropolis. “Two people were killed and 11 others were injured in shootings Thursday across Chicago,” reports the Chicago Sun Times. “The latest fatal attack left one man dead and another injured that afternoon on the Southwest Side.” An additional 10 people were shot -and one killed- the day before. A disturbing report from Cook County, Illinois released this week shows Chicago’s homicide rate jumping 52% since the Coronavirus pandemic spread across the United States earlier this year. “The medical examiner’s office for the nation’s second-largest county said 95 percent of the victims were people of color, and Chicago has already recorded more homicides this year than in all of 2019, USA Today reported,” reports The Hill. Homicides spike 52 percent in Chicago amid coronavirus pandemic https://t.co/pi2HxM8N5N pic.twitter.com/zO9sLPwZHr — The Hill (@thehill) September 17, 2020  “That’s not gonna happen. I will see him in court,” Mayor Lightfoot said after President Trump suggested bringing in the National Guard. “It’s not gonna happen, not in my city. And I’m not confident that the president has the power to do that. But we have our lawyers hard at work and if he tries to do that and usurp the power of our governor, and myself as the mayor, we will see him in court.” Read the full report here. Embattled Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot continued to deflect criticism of her administration’s response to the city’s spiraling gun violence this week; blaming a lack of “federal strategy” to curb the shootings. “We have got to make sure that we do a better job of taking guns out of the hands of criminals,” Lightfoot said Friday on MSNBC Live With Stephanie Ruhle. “We have to have a federal policy on background checks and making sure that dangerous people are not able to go across the border to states like Indiana and get military-grade weapons in quantities and then bring them back to the streets and shoot people up. That’s what’s happening.” Shootings in May spiked 71% in 2020. “There’s way too many illegal guns on our streets, and we can’t fight that fight alone,” she said. “We got to have a federal strategy on this. We’re going to continue to do what we can do. We’re going to continue to make sure that we are flooding these dangerous hot spots with resources to make sure that we keep our communities safe, but we’re fighting a losing battle. If we don’t have a federal partnership on restricting access to guns in the hands of dangerous criminals, we’ve got to have partnership on that.” “Violence is crimes of poverty, violence is crimes of people feeling like they have no hope,” Lightfoot said. “When we see young men feeling they’re like only destiny is to be on a corner on somebody’s drug spot, we got to change that around and let them know that their future actually can and should be in careers and college, but we’ve got to make those kinds of investments to make that real. … We’ve got to the find the resources, and we have them, to uplift neighborhoods.” Read the full report at the Washington Examiner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9287,https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-lost-support-most-counties-held-final-campaign-rallies-2020-11,Trump Lost Support in Most Counties Where He Held Final Rallies,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since President Trump lost support between 2016 and 2020 in most of the areas where he held rallies in the final weeks of the election campaign, according to an NBC analysis of his campaign stops. NBC News analysed Trump's 30 campaign stops made in the two weeks before the final Election Day on November 3 before Biden was projected to have defeated the sitting president by 306 electoral college votes to 232. In 25 of the counties Trump visited, he achieved a smaller margin of victory than in 2016 or lost the county altogether, and he achieved a bigger margin of victory in just 5, NBC reported. The data does not prove whether the campaign stops had a net positive effect or whether his margin of defeat would have been even greater in those counties had he not made those stops at all. However, it does call into question parallel drawn by Trump and his supporters between the size of his rallies and his performance in the election. Campaign figures including Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, have claimed without evidence that the size of Trump rallies provide evidence that Biden was unlikely to have won the election. ""I think it's very hard for people to rationalize that a guy like Joe Biden — who could barely scrape together 12 people to go to a campaign event for him, you know, even a couple of weeks ago — suddenly somehow got around 80 million votes,"" said Lara Trump in November. ""Donald Trump gained 10 million votes from 2016. We all were out working across the country hard. You saw that tens of thousands of people would come to Trump events and then, like, 12 to 20 people showing up to a Joe Biden event,"" she said. The president on Sunday tweeted ""NO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION!"" in reference to a video showing a large presence at one of his rallies. The Trump campaign has failed to produce evidence to substantiate its claims of widespread voter fraud in the election. Multiple lawsuits filed by the president's lawyers which contested the election's outcome have also been unsuccessful. The president, who held dozens of rallies throughout this year despite the coronavirus pandemic, told crowds on several occasions during the campaign that he was only holding the rallies because he believed they would boost his vote count. He told a crowd in Michigan at one such rally in October that — were it not for the pandemic — he would not have been forced to speak to the assembled crowd of supporters. ""I probably wouldn't be standing out here in the freezing rain with you. I'd be home in the White House, doing whatever the hell I was doing. I wouldn't be out here,"" he told the audience in Ingham County, Michigan. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before Biden flipped the state back this year. Trump's margin of defeat in Ingham County went on to increase from 27% to 32%, per NBC. The president made similar comments during a campaign rally in Erie County, Pennsylvania — a key swing county in a battleground state — earlier in October. ""Four or five months ago when we started this whole thing — because, you know, before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn't coming to Erie,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I have to be honest, there's no way I was coming."" Trump went onto lose the state by 1 point, having won it by 1.6 points in 2016, per NBC. He also lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes. Campaign figures including Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, have claimed without evidence that the size of Trump rallies provide evidence that Biden was unlikely to have won the election.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been more than 330,000 confirmed cases of the virus during that time in New Jersey. Murphy was recently accosted while he ate dinner with his family without wearing a mask. As The Daily Wire reported: Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy was accosted by angry residents while he ate dinner with his family until he put a mask on, according to footage that went viral Sunday. “Oh my God, Murphy, you are such a d***,” one woman says in a video posted on social media. Murphy does not respond. “You’re having fun with your family, in the meantime, you’re having all kind of other bulls*** going on…,” another woman says. Murphy’s son then suggests the women might have had too much to drink and asks them to put their masks on, to which one of the women says, “You can go f*** yourself, how’s that? I don’t need a f***ing mask. You know why I don’t need a mask? Because there ain’t nothing f***ing wrong with me.” When Murphy’s son points out how one of the women has a Trump phone case, he claims Trump likes his dad. “No, he doesn’t like your father,” the woman responds.

Within hours of the memo being released, the head of the branch of the Justice Department that prosecutes election crimes, Richard Pilger, resigned in protest. Pilger, who was director of the Election Crimes Branch of the DOJ, sent a memo to colleagues that suggested his resignation was linked to Barr’s memo.

Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism (my most cherished Departmental recognition), I must regretfully resign from my role as Director of the Election Crimes Branch,” Pilger’s letter stated.

He was involved in the alleged targeting of Tea Party organizations. Pilger, when subpoenaed to Capitol Hill by Darrell Issa in 2014, refused to answer over three dozen questions under oath on the advice of DOJ attorneys. The issuance of the memo is a change in Justice Department policy, which had previously advised prosecutors that “overt investigative steps ordinarily should not be taken until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded.” Barr declared that guidance as being outdated: “Such a passive and delayed enforcement approach can result in situations in which election misconduct cannot realistically be rectified,” Barr said in the memo. I posed a thread about how the gatekeeper of criminal election fraud at the DOJ is Richard Pilger, who worked closely with Lois Lerner at the IRS in the Obama days (ie, when the DOJ rabidly pursued the president's agenda — good, bad, or mostly ugly — to target Tea Party orgs. https://t.co/22MPpmzffl — Harmeet K.

Despite numerous calls for Brackenfell residents to not engage with EFF protesters during their protest on Friday in the community, a white resident made his way to the front of the EFF’s makeshift stage in the middle of Frans Conradie and allegedly hurled racial slurs and profanities at the crowd while the party’s general secretary, Marshall Dlamini, was speaking. EFF members responded to the provocation by beating and stomping on the man as he lay screaming at their feet. He was rescued by the police a few minutes later. Police called on the crowd to disperse, which was met with some resistance at first and quickly turned around as the police began firing rubber bullets, throwing stun grenades, released tear gas and utilised water cannon trucks. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “One member of the public was injured after he attempted to disrupt the EFF protest. He was arrested on the scene on a charge of incitement and is also due in court in due course.” The injured resident said that he had decided to set the EFF crowd straight after their continuous calls for white people to be done away with. He said: “I am willing to die for my country. What the EFF are saying and doing here is wrong. South Africa is for all who live in it regardless of race and culture. Both Afrikaans people and black people belong here, and I had to let them know that.” Meanwhile, a few metres away, dispersing protesters began throwing rocks and sticks in retaliation at police officers and law enforcement, vandalising a few businesses, private vehicles and state vehicles, as well as setting alight open fields in the community and surrounding areas. Van Wyk said: “The protest action in Brackenfell necessitated police action to maintain law and to disperse the riotous crowd. Eight protestors were arrested on charges of public violence and they are due in court once they have been charged. “As the protesters dispersed, they were throwing stones at all Law Enforcement agencies as well as businesses. Several SAPS, Law Enforcement vehicles, windows of businesses as well as private vehicles were damaged. “The crowd has since dispersed but the situation in the area is still being monitored. Our forces will remain in the area until we are satisfied that the situation has stabilised.” Police and some @EFFSouthAfrica members clash in #Brackenfell.#effinbrakenfell#BrackenfellHighSchool📹 @PJikelo / @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/P549Kjg54F Cape Argus Share this article: Sections on IOL Follow IOL More on IOL Legal Trending on IOL Newspapers © 2021 Independent Online and affiliated companies.

9534,http://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/25/staff-at-jordan-petersons-publisher-protest-new-book-plans,Staff at Jordan Peterson's publisher protest new book plans,"Penguin Random House Canada’s plans to publish a new work by the ‘professor against political correctness’ has reportedly prompted numerous complaints Last modified on Thu 21 Jan 2021 11.16 EST The announcement of a new book from Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, the self-styled “professor against political correctness”, has prompted dozens of complaints from staff at his publisher in Canada, according to a report. Vice’s story on Tuesday said that the announcement of Peterson’s forthcoming Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, a follow-up to his global bestseller 12 Rules for Life, prompted “several” staff at Penguin Random House Canada (PRH Canada) to confront management. Peterson’s views on subjects including transgender rights, gender and race have been controversial. Last year, Cambridge University rescinded its offer of a visiting fellowship to Peterson. Also in 2019, 12 Rules for Life was temporarily pulled from sale in a New Zealand book chain after the terrorist attack on a Christchurch mosque, over perceived links between Peterson’s fanbase and Islamophobia.  At a PRH Canada town hall meeting on Monday, one employee told Vice, “people were crying about how Jordan Peterson has affected their lives”. PRH Canada’s diversity and inclusion committee reportedly received at least 70 anonymous messages about Peterson’s book from staff, with only “a couple” in favour of the decision to publish. In response, PRH Canada told Vice that it “immediately” held the forum after announcing its plans to publish Beyond Order and “provided a space for our employees to express their views and offer feedback”. The publisher’s statement said: “Our employees have started an anonymous feedback channel, which we fully support. We are open to hearing our employees’ feedback and answering all of their questions. We remain committed to publishing a range of voices and viewpoints.” Peterson’s daughter Mikhaila tweeted a link to the Vice article. “How to improve business in 2 steps: Step 1: identify crying adults. Step 2: fire,” she wrote. “If you don’t think adults willing to cry to get their way in a workplace is a problem … you’re clearly not in charge of many people.” Peterson’s Beyond Order, which is due out in March, promises to deliver “12 more lifesaving principles for resisting the exhausting toll that our desire to order the world inevitably takes”. “In a time when the human will increasingly imposes itself over every sphere of life – from our social structures to our emotional states – Peterson warns that too much security is dangerous,” says the publisher. “What’s more, he offers strategies for overcoming the cultural, scientific, and psychological forces causing us to tend toward tyranny, and teaches us how to rely instead on our instinct to find meaning and purpose, even – and especially – when we find ourselves powerless.” The Guardian understands that no staff at PRH in the UK have complained about the decision to publish Peterson again. The protests in Canada over Peterson’s book follow Hachette’s decision to drop Woody Allen’s memoir after a staff walkout, and reports that staff at JK Rowling’s publisher in the UK were told they could not refuse to work on her new children’s book The Ickabog because they disagreed with her views on transgender rights. This article was amended on 21 January 2021 to remove a statement that the offer to Jordan Peterson was rescinded “following criticism from faculty and students”. Cambridge University has informed the Guardian that the decision was made by the Research Committee of the Faculty of Divinity prior to and independently of the receipt of any external comment on the matter by other university staff or students.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commander of the 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo, made this known on Saturday when he appeared before the Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up by the state government to investigate cases of police brutality. He also insisted that the military only fired into the air and not directly at the #EndSARS protesters. While explaining that the blank bullets used cannot cause any damage to the flesh, Brigadier Taiwo said if real bullets were indeed fired, one bullet had the potency to kill three persons at one shot.

While a curfew had been put in place to contain the violence that had broken out in parts of the state by persons who hijacked the peaceful protests, the army said it did not get the update that the timing which had initially been set to commence at 4:00 pm, was shifted to 9:00 pm. Brigadier General Taiwo also maintained that the troops were not only deployed to the Lekki tollgate but also to other areas like Badagry, Ikorodu, Apapa, Alimosho, Epe, Lagos Island and the entire state to restore normalcy. Furthermore, he claimed that after the soldiers left the area, hoodlums went on to destroy the toll gate plaza. Watch Full Video Below   The army had initially described reports of its involvement in the shooting as fake news before admitting to being present at the scene. Viral reports online had insinuated that not only were they present, but they shot at and killed several persons and allegedly hid the bodies. Both the army and the state government have, however faulted the reports, insisting that only two persons had been confirmed dead from the incident. “Two dead bodies. That is what we have seen from all the morgues, that is what we have going to hospitals, that is what we have seen as records,” governor Sanwo-Olu had said in an interview with CNN.

9547,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/17/thailand-protests-clashes-cause-chaos-outside-parliament,Thailand protests: clashes cause chaos outside parliament,"Skirmishes break out between rival groups as police fire water cannon and MPs flee in boats Last modified on Tue 17 Nov 2020 23.36 EST Thailand’s riverside parliament was surrounded by chaos as police repeatedly fired water cannon at pro-democracy protesters, clashes broke out between the demonstrators and royalist counterparts, and MPs abandoned the scene in boats. Five people were treated for gunshot wounds, including at least two students, after the most violent clashes since a youth-led movement emerged in July. A total of 55 people suffered injuries in the protests, according to Bangkok’s Erawan emergency medical centre.  For months, a youth-led protest movement has held escalating demonstrations calling for democratic reforms. They have demanded the removal of the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general, and have breached longstanding taboos to call for an accountable and transparent monarchy. Dozens have faced legal charges for taking part in the rallies. On Tuesday, as lawmakers considered whether to debate several proposals to amend the constitution – an issue central to protesters’ demands – thousands gathered outside the Thai parliament, which had been blocked off with razor wire and concrete. Protesters outside parliament mocked the military-backed government by bringing giant inflatable ducks to the rally, which some joked would float down the river to an otherwise inaccessible parliament. The ducks, nicknamed by some as their “navy force”, were instead used to shelter from blasts of water cannon, which in some instances contained chemical irritants. Teargas was also used on pro-democracy protesters, who wore hard hats and goggles for protection. Groups of demonstrators could be seen coughing and pouring water over their faces to ease the stinging. “Stop accusing us of violating the law, you [the police] are violating the law by hurting people,” Parit Chiwarak, a prominent student leader also known as Penguin, said through a megaphone later in the evening. “We are fighting for a better future of our country and for everyone so don’t fire water cannon on us.” A police spokesman said water cannon were used because protesters were attempting to break into a restricted area. Despite a heavy police presence around parliament, skirmishes broke out between royalists, who wore yellow shirts, and pro-democracy protesters during the afternoon. Both sides threw stones and water bottles after police retreated from one of the barricades, the first major clash between royalists and the student-led movement. Skirmishes occurred again later in the evening, when gunshots were fired. In one video, shared widely on social media and apparently filmed among yellow shirt royalists, a speaker warns the opposing side to control their crowd, and not to throw a firecracker. What sounds like several gunshots are fired. A person close to the camera, far from the front line, watches on saying “shoot them, shoot them”. Mint Suttawan, an MP for the progressive opposition party Move Forward, told the Guardian she had visited two injured students at Rama 9 hospital. Both had been shot in the leg but were conscious, she said. They had attended the demonstration as protest guards for the pro-democracy movement – volunteers who stand on the front line to manage the crowds and ensure demonstrators’ safety. Royalists held a counter-demonstration earlier in the day, where they urged lawmakers not to change the constitution. “Amending the constitution is going to lead to the abolition of the monarchy,” the royalist leader, Warong Dechgitvigrom, told reporters. Protesters have said they do not want abolition of the monarchy, but believe it should be brought under the constitution. They have also called for the removal of harsh defamation laws that protect the royal family from criticism. Anyone who “defames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir apparent or regent” can face up to 15 years in prison. Strict lèse majesté laws make it a crime to criticise, defame or insult members of Thailand's royal family. In practice, this means open discussion or critical reporting about the royal family is considered illegal. The military junta, which seized power in 2014, has been criticised for using the law – which can see people jailed for up to 15 years on each count – to stifle opposition. In 2015, a man was jailed for 30 years over six Facebook posts and the local printer of the New York Times refused to publish an edition with a story on the king. Surrounded by the unrest, several MPs and senators left parliament in the afternoon on boats from a pier behind the building. On Wednesday they are expected to vote on which, if any, of seven constitutional amendment bills should be debated. The most controversial, which aims to undo the changes introduced under military rule, has been put forward by the human rights NGO iLaw. It says the 250 military-appointed senators should be replaced with elected officials, and does not, like other proposals, prevent changes to parts of the constitution that relate to the monarchy. However, despite receiving about 100,000 signatures it is unlikely to pass. The royal palace has not responded to the protests, although the king has said of demonstrators “we love them all the same”. In recent comments, he described Thailand as the “land of compromise”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

News By Tamar Lapin Submit November 1, 2020 | 12:10pm | Updated November 1, 2020 | 3:38pm Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more. President Trump made an appeal to voters in Michigan Sunday — kicking off the first of a marathon five rallies planned for the day. The president addressed a crowd of supporters at the Michigan Sports Stars Park in Washington, where he touted the US economy and bashed his Democratic rival Joe Biden’s policy proposals. “Joe Biden will shut down your economy,” Trump said. Speaking outdoors in windy 39-degree weather, the president quipped that he might need to borrow a better jacket from members of the crowd. “It’s really a contest to see whether we can all stand it,” he said. “And we’re loving it.” Trump also recalled being at a concert where Italian opera tenor Luciano Pavarotti refused to sing because he was uncomfortable — but said he wouldn’t leave over the chilly weather because, “I’m not a diva.” Speaking about coronavirus lockdowns, Trump took aim at Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, saying she was “not doing a good job,” and also hit at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. “What Cuomo has done to New York is unbelievable, it’s terrible,” he said. He also touted Michigan congressional candidate Lisa McClain and John James, who is running for senate in the Wolverine State. The president also spoke about the brutal knife attack in Nice, France, that left three people dead Thursday, saying that he called President Emanuel Macron to offer his condolences. He then segued into remarks on immigration — claiming the Democrats would put put Minn. Rep. Ilhan Omar “in charge of immigration” if Biden won. With just two days until Election Day, the president is hosting an onslaught of events in battleground states. Following the event in Michigan, he was set to travel to Dubuque, Iowa; Hickory, North Carolina.; Rome, Georgia; and Opa-locka, Florida, later in the day. He’ll hold five more rallies on Monday to close out the final full day of the campaign. Meanwhile, Biden will spend much of Sunday in Pennsylvania, where Trump campaigned on Saturday. The former vice president will participate in a “souls to the polls” event in Philadelphia aimed at encouraging black church congregations to organize and vote.

County's public health director,"Dozens of demonstrators converged outside the Echo Park home of Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Sunday afternoon to express their displeasure with a new round of COVID-19 restrictions that will take effect Monday. Carrying signs and waving flags, the protesters called on Ferrer to “Open L.A.” and chanted, “No science. No data. No shutdown.” Few of the 50 or so demonstrators were wearing face masks. More people here now, and a bit of a shouting match erupting between the protesters and a resident on this street. pic.twitter.com/SQ6YYZ2FcB   The county’s latest Safer at Home order was announced Tuesday amid an alarming increase in coronavirus cases and COVID-19 deaths. Its slew of restrictions includes a ban on most gatherings, stricter limits on retail businesses, and closures of playgrounds that aren’t part of a school or childcare center. The order will be in effect for three weeks, until Dec. 20. Those restrictions came on the heels of a previously announced rule that suspended outdoor dining at restaurants throughout most of the county. Pasadena, which has its own health department, opted to allow outdoor dining to continue. In addition, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced a statewide curfew that forbids nonessential gatherings with members of other households between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The recent restrictions have drawn the ire of business owners, exhausted parents and others who are simply losing patience with the pandemic way of life. One of the protesters outside Ferrer’s home carried a sign that read, “Newsom and Ferrer are non-essential.” Another shouted, “How dare you take away our guns and lock us in?” California L.A. County’s new stay-home order is the strictest in California. Here’s how it works Los Angeles County has issued a new COVID-19 pandemic order in a desperate move aimed at slowing an unprecedented surge of coronavirus infections.   Some of the demonstrators raised other grievances, including the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Several people brought Trump flags, and one held a sign that declared “Trump won.” Several people got into heated exchanges with Ferrer’s neighbors, including one resident who called the protesters “fascists” and Nazis.” Though noisy at times, the protest remained peaceful until the demonstrators dispersed around 5 p.m. California Photos: Gov. Newsom announces new stay-at-home order as COVID-19 hospitalizations hit record Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced a stay-at-home order affecting most of California.   A Los Angeles Police Department vehicle was parked in Ferrer’s shared driveway to monitor the protest. LAPD officials could not be reached for comment Sunday night. For the most part, L.A. County residents have taken heed of the public health orders intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the community. But patience is wearing thin, and some people have become more vocal in opposing them. The county is now averaging nearly 4,200 new coronavirus cases each day, a tally that exceeds the number of daily cases reported during the summer. Hospitalizations have been on the rise for the past two weeks and are now just shy of 2,200, nearly meeting the previous high from the summer. Over the last week, L.A. County has averaged nearly 28 COVID-19 deaths each day. Times staff writers David Zahniser and Laura Nelson contributed to this report.

(Antioch Police Department via AP) A 17-year-old from Illinois who is charged with killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin and whose case has become a rallying cry for some conservatives posted $2 million bail Friday and was released from custody. Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz during a demonstration Aug. 25 that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. He posted bond through his attorney at about 2 p.m., Kenosha County Sheriff’s Sgt. David Wright said. Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, told police he was attacked while he was guarding a business and that he fired in self-defense. He faces multiple charges, including intentional homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Wisconsin law doesn’t permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless they’re hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing. His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for him has attracted millions of dollars in donations, and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September. Huber’s father, John Huber, asked Kenosha County Circuit Court Commissioner Loren Keating during a hearing Nov. 2 to set Rittenhouse’s bail between $4 million and $10 million. Huber said Rittenhouse thinks he’s above the law and noted the effort to raise money on his behalf. He also suggested militia groups would hide him from police if he were released. Rittenhouse’s attorney, Mark Richards, asked for $750,000 bail. Keating ultimately set bail at $2 million, saying Rittenhouse was a flight risk given the seriousness of the charges against him.

Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) likened President Donald Trump's campaign rallies to Ku Klux Klan rallies in a Monday interview with the Washington Post. Trump ""chose to speak about me at every single rally, didn't really matter where he was, sometimes multiple times in a day, as he held his Klan rallies across the country,"" Omar said to Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart. Omar, a member of the far-left group of House Democrats known as ""the Squad,"" reflected on ousting President Trump and what she perceived as ""a four-year assault"" on refugees and immigrants like her. She also discussed infighting between moderate and leftist Democrats, sparked by the party's lackluster House and Senate election results. Omar said in the interview that the rift within the Democratic Party ""isn't as strong as it's being made out to be,"" despite House Democrats' chaotic post-election phone call. During the call, Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who was first elected to the House alongside Omar in 2018, blamed leftists' radical anti-police and socialist messaging for her near-loss in this election. Throughout the Trump presidency, ""the Squad"" and other progressive Democrats have likened President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists and white supremacists. Omar also compared the president's rallies to Klan rallies in a tweet last year. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) quoted a Klansman to criticize Trump's national security policies in a tweet last year, and failed Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke compared Trump's rallies to Nazi meetings.

9764,https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2020-election/trump-supporters-protest-outside-vote-centers-in-arizona-michigan/,"Trump supporters protest outside vote centers in Arizona, Michigan","NewsNation Now Alexa Mencia PHOENIX (NewsNation Now) — Crowds of supporters for President Donald Trump gathered outside vote centers in Arizona and Michigan Wednesday, expressing concerns about the counting of ballots. In Phoenix, roughly 100 protesters converged in front of the Maricopa County Elections Department, chanting “Stop the steal!” and “Count my vote.” Many were without masks and some were armed with rifles and handguns. The rally comes as The Associated Press has declared Democratic nominee Joe Biden as the winner in Arizona, flipping a state that has a long political history of voting Republican. Trump had won Arizona in 2016. The AP called the race early Wednesday morning, after an analysis of ballots concluded that there weren’t enough outstanding to allow Trump to catch up. Gilbert resident Chris Michael, 40, joined protesters outside the Maricopa County Elections Department Wednesday night. Michael told Reuters that he came to make sure all votes are counted. He said he wants assurances that the counting was done “ethically and legally.” Republican Rep. Paul Gosar also joined the crowd, declaring: “We’re not going to let this election be stolen. Period.” Observers from both major political parties were inside the election center as ballots were processed and counted, and the procedure was live-streamed online at all times. Several sheriff’s deputies blocked the entrance to the building. The vote-counting carried on into the night, Maricopa County Elections Department spokeswoman Megan Gilbertson said. Two top county officials — one a Democrat, the other a Republican — issued a statement expressing concern about how misinformation had spread about the integrity of the election process. “Everyone should want all the votes to be counted, whether they were mailed or cast in person,” said the statement signed by Clint Hickman, the GOP chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Democratic Supervisor Steve Gallardo. “An accurate vote takes time. … This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.” In Detroit, Trump supporters gathered by a ballot-tallying center shortly before The Associated Press declared that Biden had won Michigan. Video shot by local media showed angry people gathered outside the TCF Center and inside the lobby, with police officers lined up to keep them from entering the counting area. They chanted “Stop the count!” and “Stop the vote!” Earlier, Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit in a bid to halt the count, demanding Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors. Trump has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there are major problems with the voting and the counting. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and the public had been given access to the tallying “using a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that all ballots are counted fairly and accurately.” The Trump campaign also filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania and Georgia Wednesday, laying the groundwork for contesting the battleground states as he slipped behind Biden. The new filings, joining existing Republican legal challenges in Pennsylvania and Nevada, demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and absentee ballot concerns, the campaign said. Protests were also reported in other areas of the country, including in Portland, where a riot was declared Wednesday. Many took to the streets in Seattle and New York City overnight, as well.

Ian Chappell wants shots like this from Glenn Maxwell outlawed.Source:Getty Images It’s only taken two one-dayers for Ian Chappell’s first angry rant of the summer. The former Australian captain has unloaded his frustration at batting tactics employed by Glenn Maxwell and David Warner he believes are blatantly unfair. Maxwell in particular is one of the finest exponents of switch-hitting, where a batsman faces up in his normal position before moving his feet – and sometimes altering his grip – to effectively swap his stance. Chappell conceded it was “amazingly skilful” but insisted it wasn’t fair on the bowler after two run-fests at the SCG to open the series. “How can one side of the game, ie. the bowlers, they have to tell the umpire how they’re going to bowl. And yet the batsman, he lines up as a right-hander – I’m the fielding captain, I place the field for the right-hander – and before the ball’s been delivered, the batsman becomes a left-hander,” Chappell told nine.com.au. “One of the main reasons why he’s becoming a left-hander is so he can take advantage of those field placings. I’d love the administrators who made those laws, I’d love them to explain to me how that’s fair.” Chappell encouraged India to revolt against the practice by challenging the on-field umpire. “I just can’t believe the players don’t arc-up about it. If I’m captain, I’m going to take the ball myself and I’m going to tell the umpire I’m bowling right-arm over [the wicket], and then I’m going to run in and bowl around,” he said. “Obviously the umpire‘s going to complain and I’m going to say, ’Well, you stop him (the batsman) doing something I think is totally unfair and I’ll stop doing something unfair’. If the administrators aren’t smart enough to change it, then my attitude always was, ‘Well, I’ll take the law into my own hands’.” Glenn Maxwell positions himself for a switch hit.

But when he completely becomes the opposite-handed batsman to what he faces up as, then it’s not fair. “If he’s good enough to do it by excellent footwork or whatever other means he can devise, I don’t have a problem with it. But when it’s blatantly unfair, it annoys the hell out of me.” A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.
